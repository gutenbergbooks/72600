<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>THE BROKEN NOTE</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was in the spring of the year 1241 that rumors began to
travel along the highroad from Kiev in the land of Rus
that the Tartars of the East were again upon the march.
Men trembled when they heard that news and mothers held
their children close to their breasts, for the name “Tartar”
was one that froze folks’ blood in their veins. As the weeks
went on, the rumors grew thicker and there began to come
through to Poland, our land of the fields, the news that the
country lands of the Ukraine were ablaze. Then it was heard
that Kiev had fallen, then Lvov, the city of the Lion, and
now there was naught between the savage band of warriors
and the fair city of Krakow, save a few peaceful villages and
fertile fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tartars came through the world like a horde of wild
beasts. They left not one thing alive nor one green blade of
wheat standing. They were short, dark men of shaggy beards
and long hair twisted into little braids, and they rode on small
horses which they covered with trophies that they had gained
in war. Brave they were as lions, courageous they were as
great dogs, but they had hearts of stone and knew not mercy,
nor pity, nor tenderness, nor God. On their horses they
carried round shields of leather and iron, and long spears
often trailed from their saddles. About their shoulders and
thighs they wore skins of animals. Some decorated their ears
with golden rings—here and there one wore a gold ring in
the nose. When they traveled, the dust rose high into the
sky from beneath the hoofs of their little horses, and the
thunder of the hoofbeats could be heard many miles away.
They were so numerous that it took days for the whole horde
to pass any one given point, and for miles behind the army
itself rumbled carts bearing slaves, provisions, and booty—usually
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before them went always a long, desperate procession of
country people driven from their humble homes by the news
of the coming terror; they had already said farewell to the
cottages where they lived, the parting from which was almost
as bitter as death. So it has always been in time of war that
the innocent suffer most—these poor, helpless peasants with
their carts and horses and geese and sheep trudging along
through the dust to escape, if God so willed, the terrible fate
which would befall them were they left behind. There were
old people in that procession too feeble to be stirring even
about a house, mothers nursing children, women weak with
sickness, and men broken-hearted at the loss of all that a lifetime
of labor had brought. Children dragged themselves
wearily along beside them, often bearing their pets in their
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this company Krakow opened her gates, and prepared
for defense. Many of the nobility and rich citizens had, in
the meantime, fled to the west or taken refuge in monasteries
far to the north. The brothers of the monastery at Zvierzyniec,
a short distance outside the city, took in all the
refugees that the building could accommodate, and then prepared
to stand siege. But the great, weary, terror-mad mob
that had fled ahead of the band of Tartars was content
enough to make the city itself its destination. And once
within its walls all turned their faces toward the south. For
there, in the south of the city, towering on its rocky hill high
over the Vistula River, was the great, irregular, turreted mass
that was the Wawel—the fortress and castle of the kings of
Poland from the time of Krakus, the legend king, and the
home of the dukes and nobles who formed the king’s court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been decided to make no attempt to defend the city
outside the castle gates, since that would entail a great loss of
life; and so for several days the city dwellers who remained and
these refugees from all the country about poured into the fortification
and were housed inside its walls. The old castle gates
which were then on Castle Highway opposite the Church of
St. Andrew were at last shut and barricaded, and the walls
were manned with citizen soldiery prepared to give their
lives for the protection of the city and their families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tartars fell upon the city in the night and, after burning
the outlying villages, pillaged the districts that lay about
the churches of St. Florian, St. John, and the Holy Cross. The
whole night long was one of hideous sounds—the crackling
and fury of flames, the snarling and yelling of the enemy when
they found that the prey had fled, their roars of triumph when
they came upon gold and treasure. As morning dawned the
watchers from the Wawel looked out over the town and saw
but three churches not already in flames. These were the
Church of Our Lady Mary near the great market, the Church
of St. Andrew with its stalwart towers at the Castle Gate, and
the Church of St. Adalbert in the market place. Already a
colony of Jews in the Black Village had perished, also those
refugees and town dwellers who had not rushed inside the walls
of defense. There remained but one man—or rather a youth—still
alive in the midst of all that destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was the trumpeter of the Church of Our Lady Mary,
and he had taken solemn oath to sound the trumpet each hour
of the day and night from a little balcony high up on the front
of the church. As the first golden rays of the sun changed the
Vistula from a dark line to a plash of dancing gold, he mounted
this balcony to sound the Heynal—the hymn to Our Lady
which every trumpeter in the church had in the past sworn to
play each hour of the day and night—“until death.” He felt
with a strange joy the glow of the sun as it fell upon him that
morning, for the night had been very dark both with its
own shadow and with the gloomy blackness of men’s ruthlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About his feet, down in the town highway, stood groups of
short, fierce men gazing up at him curiously. Here and there
the roof of a house was shooting upward in flames and belching
forth clouds of black smoke. Hundreds of dwellings lay
charred and ruined by the conflagration. He was alone in
the midst of a terrible enemy—he might have fled on the previous
day and gained the castle with the refugees and the town
dwellers, but he had been true to his oath and remained at
his post until he should be driven away. Now it was too late
to retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a very young man, perhaps nineteen or twenty, and
wore a dark cloth suit that was caught at the knees with
buckles, like the knickerbockers of a later generation; dark,
thick hose extended from the knees to the tops of his soft,
pointed sandals, and a short coat falling just below the waist
was held together in front by a belt. The head covering was
of leather and something like a cowl; it fell clear to his
shoulders and ran up over the head in such a way that only
his face and a bit of hair were visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother and sister are safe,” he thought. “May God
be praised for that! They are gone these ten days and must
be now with the cousins in Moravia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came to him then what a sweet thing life is. The sun
over the Vistula was now reflected in the windows of the
Cathedral of the Wawel where the priests were already saying
mass. At the tops of all the gates he could see guards in
full armor upon which the sunlight flashed. A banner with a
white eagle hung in the air above the gate at the great draw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poland lives,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then it came to him, young as he was, that he was part
of the glorious company of Polish men that was fighting for
all Christendom against brutal and savage invaders. He had
not seen much of death before that minute—he had heard of
it only as something vague. And now, he himself was perhaps
going out to meet it, because of his oath, because of his
love for the Church, because of his love for Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall keep my word,” he mused. “If I die it shall be for
that. My word is as good as my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had a painter caught his expression then, he would have
caught only the expression of a very great peace—an expression
that signified somehow that God was very close. There
was no moment of weakness, no faltering, no suffering even—for
he did not think of what might come after his duty was performed.
The sand in the hourglass already marked the hour
for the trumpet to sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, for Poland and Our Lady I will sound the Heynal,”
he said, and raised the trumpet to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Softly he blew at first—then, thrilled with a sense of
triumph, he felt in his heart a joy that was almost ecstatic. He
seemed to see in a vision that though he might now die alone
and for naught save what perhaps some scoffing ones might
call a foolish honor, still that bravery was to descend as a
heritage to the people to whom he belonged, and was to become
a part of their spirit, their courage, their power of everlasting—all
this that moment brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Tartar below crouched to his bow and drew back the
arrow as far as he could draw. The string whirred. The
dark shaft flew like a swift bird straight for the mark. It
pierced the breast of the young trumpeter when he was near
the end of his song—it quivered there a moment and the song
ceased. But still holding to the trumpet the youth fell back
against the supporting wall and blew one last glorious note;
it began strongly, trembled, and then ceased—broken like the
young life that gave it birth, and at that moment those below
applied the torch to the wooden church and it, too, rose in
flames to Heaven, with the soul of the youth among them.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MAN WHO WOULDN’T SELL HIS PUMPKIN</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was in late July of the year 1461 that the sun rose one
morning red and fiery as if ushering in midsummer’s hottest
day. His rays fell upon the old city of Krakow and
the roads leading up to it, along which rolled and rocked a very
caravan of peasants’ wagons. They were drawn mostly by
single horses hitched into place by the side of a rough pole that
served for shaft; for wheels there were stout pieces of board
nailed tightly together and cut round about, baked with fire
at the rim to harden them; for body they had but rude cross
boards as a floor, with sides and ends of plaited willow reeds,
so that the wagons had the appearance of large baskets traveling
on wheels. As they moved along a road often rough from
holes and stones, out through fields sometimes, and even across
streams, the wagons pitched about like little boats on a wind-swept
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In many cases the drivers were walking alongside the carts,
flicking their long whips now and then above the horses’ backs
to give the animals a little encouragement, while upon the seats
sat the patient figures of women and children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wagons was all manner of merchandise—vegetables,
flowers, ducks, hens and geese, pigs, butter and milk. Here a
driver was conveying a load of skins, here one had nothing but
black earth for enriching city gardens. Another, driving a load
of poultry, wore around his neck, like beads, garland after garland
of dried mushrooms strung upon strings. At the back of
the picture rose the foothills of the Carpathians, misty and
golden in the early sun, and at a distance the Vistula River
curved like a silver bracelet about the Wawel Hill. All about
was the early-morning smell of wet grass and fresh earth and
growing things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Market day had begun. All night some of these wagons had
been traveling along the highways that spread out from the
great highway that was the Krakow, Tarnov, Lvov, Kiev
route. Some had been on the march for two days and two
nights, so distant were the borders of the province. Here were
men and women in town dress from the larger centers, here
were barefooted peasants in long coats and round hats, here
were peasant women in rough garments but with head scarfs
and shawls of dazzling colors, here were the inhabitants of a
Jewish village, twelve men in black robes and black hats, with
the characteristic orthodox curls hanging down in front of
their ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here were boys belonging to the retinue of a local <span class='it'>szlachcic</span>
or country gentleman, their leather costumes showing up to
advantage beside the rather dingy dress of the male portion of
the peasantry. Here and there were women with little babies,
here and there were old people trudging by the sides of their
wagons up to market, as they had done for thirty or forty
years past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But every man in that caravan carried some sort of weapon,
either a short knife at the belt, or quarterstaff in the hand,
or huge-headed ax at the bottom of the wagon. For thieves
were abroad in great number at times of market, and it was
even said that there were country gentlemen of ruined fortune
who were not above recouping themselves now and then at the
expense of some such caravan. Usually, however, it was on
the return trip that the thieves were numerous, for then each
villager and peasant had gold or silver as the result of the day’s
bargaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although practically all these wagons carried cargoes of
goods, there was one which seemed strangely empty for market
day. It had two horses instead of the usual one, its shaft pole
was stouter than those of the other wagons, its occupants were
better dressed than the peasants and seemed somehow not like
actual workers of the soil. In it rode the driver, a man of
perhaps forty-five years, a woman—his wife—some ten years
younger, and a boy who sat at the open end of the wagon, dangling
his legs above the dirt and mud of the highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, wife,” said the man, snapping a long whip at the off
horse—his wife was sitting beside him on a rude seat at the
front of the wagon—“that high tower you see is a watch
tower on the Wawel Hill of Krakow. Should we go as flies
the stork we should reach there by the eighth hour. See, in the
distance are the two towers of the Church of Our Lady. It is
a welcome sight to my eyes after these three weeks on a rocking
cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman threw back a gray hood from her face and
looked ahead with longing eyes. “It is Krakow, then,” she
said, “the city of my mother. Often has she told me of its
glory, and yet I never had hoped to see it. God knows I wish
I might see it differently and with less pain in my heart. But
God gives, and man receives, and we are here at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time they traveled along in silence. The man
was musing on his early experiences in Krakow, the woman on
her lost home in the Ukraine, and the boy letting his imagination
run riot in speculation as to the sights that he should see
in the great city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their thoughts were brought suddenly from their own
affairs to a commotion among the carts behind them. Drivers
were reining in their horses and swinging them to the left of
the road, narrow as it was, in order to let some one pass. The
man whose thoughts had been thus interrupted turned around,
trying to discern who it might be who was pushing forward
through the long line of carts, and in a moment he saw that it
was a rider on a small horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Way, way,” the rider was shouting. “Do you peasants
think that the whole road belongs to you? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stay on your
farm, where you belong,” he shouted angrily at a peasant
driver whose horse reared suddenly from the edge of the road
to the middle. “Give me room to pass. You have no business
on the highroad with an animal that jumps about like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had gone in the ditch else,” replied the peasant without
surliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rider glanced sharply at the contents of the man’s
wagon and being assured that it contained nothing but fresh
straw to be sold to brick-makers, dashed ahead until he was
even with the cart which held the man and woman and boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last named had been watching his advance curiously.
Now this boy, Joseph Charnetski, was in his fifteenth year. He
was not by any means handsome, though he could not be called
ugly. His hair and his eyes were dark and his face was
somewhat round and very pleasant. He wore rather rich,
though travel-soiled, nether garments, not leather like those of
the retainers, nor of coarse sacking like the peasants’ clothes,
but of a good quality of homespun, and a thick, buttoned coat
of the same material, which fell skirtlike nearly to the knees.
On his feet were brown leather boots, whose tops were soft and
loose, and so high that they reached almost to the bottom of
the coat. On his head he wore a round hat like a turban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instant the rider perceived the boy, “<span class='it'>Chlopak</span>, <span class='it'>chlopak</span>
(boy, boy),” he exclaimed in a rather croaky voice, “tell your
old man to hold his horses. You come and hold mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy obeyed, but as he leaped from the wagon and
grasped at the horse’s bit thong, he came to the conclusion that
the stranger was no friend. In those days when the world was
just emerging from a period of darkness and cruelty, it was a
necessity that each man should be constantly upon his guard
against other men. Robbers abounded—jealous friends often
descended to mean tricks; men of noble birth and breeding
thought nothing of defrauding poor peasants, and among the
poor peasants themselves were those who would commit crimes
for the sake of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore when Joseph grasped at the horse’s bit rein he
had already come to the conclusion, perhaps from something
in the stranger’s looks or speech or manner, that he was one
to be treated with caution. He was attired in a retainer’s
suit of thick cloth. The jacket was short but concealed a coat
of very light chain armor beneath. He wore for breeches not
knickerbockers but a single leather garment that combined
doublet and hose in one. The cap was round, with a hanging
jewel, probably glass, dangling behind against his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the face, however, that betrayed the soul beneath.
It was a dark, oval, wicked face—the eyes were greenish and
narrow and the eyebrow line above them ran straight across
the bridge of the nose, giving the effect of a monkey rather
than a man. One cheek was marked with a buttonlike scar,
the scar of the button plague that is so common in the lands
east of the Volga, or even the Dnieper, and marks the bearer
as a Tartar or a Cossack or a Mongol. The ears were low-set
and ugly. The mouth looked like the slit that boys make
in the pumpkins they carry on the eve of Allhallows. Above
the mouth was a cropped mustache which hung down at the
ends and straggled into a scanty beard. The man carried at
his waist a short curved sword and from the inside of his
jacket could be seen protruding the jeweled handle of an
Oriental dagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had the boy caught at his rein than the man was
off his horse and with a leap had gained the wagon. Joseph’s
father reached quickly under the wagon seat for a short cross-hilted
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not one step nearer,” he shouted as the man came toward
him with hand outstretched as if to take his hand. “Who you
may be I know not, but I stand as a Christian till I find out what
your errand is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger stopped, smiled at the ready sword still in its
scabbard, though with a sudden respect in his smile, then
pulled off his hat and made a bow. “I take it that you are
Andrew Charnetski,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take too much,” answered the driver. “To strangers
I am Pan<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Andrew Charnetski.”</p>

</table>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger bowed again. “I spoke as to an equal,” he
said. “I am Stefan Ostrovski of Chelm. But now I am
come from Kiev where I have been on state business. It is
known that one Muscovite has some important business with
our Lithuanian provinces and I, though I may not say by
whom, was sent to learn——” He broke off suddenly as if
wishing to give the impression that his business was such that
he might not speak of it in public fashion. “But on my way
home men told me that a band of Tartars had come north
from the Krim pillaging much of the country about. Among
the houses which they had burned and the fields which they had
destroyed were the house and fields of one Andrew Charnetski—nay,
I ask pardon—of Pan Andrew Charnetski, who was
reported to have escaped with his wife and son in the direction
of Krakow, where they were said to have friends. This
being true, and since I was traveling in the same direction, I
sought a description of Pan Andrew and his family, and this
morning when I saw a true Ukrainian cart, drawn by two
horses and not by one, and bearing a man and woman and
boy such as had been described to me, I took the assurance to
present myself and make my greetings to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Charnetski scrutinized the face, the clothing, and the
figure of the stranger closely. “The half is not yet told,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” answered the other, “but the rest is perhaps a tale
for you and me behind some heavy door when we reach the
city of Krakow just ahead. I have heard——” He spoke significantly,
then with his hands he described a circle in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charnetski watched him with his eyelids drawn half shut so
that he could focus his attention upon the man and see naught
of the world outside. His heart was not so cold and steady,
however, as one might think from looking at his calm, composed
features. In truth at the stranger’s gesture his heart
was beating a tattoo against his ribs. He knew that almost
every word the man had uttered was false; he knew that his
name was not Ostrovski even though there had been members
of that family in Chelm—not one feature of the man’s countenance
was Polish. And there was that in the tone of the
last words that had suggested a threat. Charnetski realized
also that here was no chance meeting. It was fourteen days
and more since they had left the border. This man, he reasoned,
had followed them all that distance, or had perhaps
been sent by some person of higher rank to intercept them before
they gained entrance to the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard naught that concerns me,” he answered
shortly. “And now since the carts are leaving me behind,
will you kindly return to your horse? I have nothing to say
that will be of importance to you, nor do you interest me in
any way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charnetski spoke truly, for the carts ahead were already
some distance away and the drivers behind were shouting at
him angrily for blocking the traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary,” answered the stranger, “you have that
which interests me greatly. And I will not leave you until
we are safe behind some door in the city. Here, boy,” he
shouted at Joseph, “lead my horse along behind the wagon,
for I intend to ride the rest of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Charnetski’s cheeks blazed. “Now, by the lightning,
you make yourself too free here,” he articulated. “State what
business you have quickly and be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man glanced around the cart and he saw on the wooden
floor just in front of the driver’s seat a huge yellow pumpkin.
“Ha,” he said, “a pumpkin, and at this time of the year.
I suppose they raise pumpkins in the winter on the steppe.
What shall be the price of that pumpkin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not for sale,” answered Charnetski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if I offer its weight in gold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not sell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, <span class='it'>no</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then”—the stranger drew his sword quickly—“then you
will fight for it!” And he stepped forward toward the driver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charnetski hesitated no longer. In the flash of an eye he
had vaulted across the seat, dodged a blow of the saber, and
caught the stranger’s right wrist in a grip of steel. The sword
dropped with a clang. Charnetski did not let the man go,
however. He threw his left hand into the small of the
stranger’s leg and with clutch upon arm and leg hoisted him
high and tossed him out of the cart. He fell in the mud,
sputtering with rage and calling curses of every description
upon Charnetski’s head. And at this minute Joseph, with admirable
foresight, swung the man’s horse about and struck
him smartly upon the right flank. The horse reared and
capered, then dashed off down the road in the direction from
which the wagons had come; at the same instant the boy leaped
upon the cart and shouted to his father who climbed back to
the seat and swung the long lash over the horses’ heads. They
were off in a second, leaving the stranger in the middle of the
highway, turning now to the right and now to the left as if
uncertain whether to pursue his horse or his enemy. And
Charnetski, swinging about, picked up the sword from the bottom
of the cart and hurled it into the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time later they reached the Kazimierz, the Jewish city
founded by King Kazimir more than one hundred years earlier.
Passing through this, they came to the bridge across the
Vistula which would admit them to the city of Krakow itself.
Finding, however, that this bridge was undergoing repairs,
they were forced to take the next bridge to the north; thence
they proceeded to the fortified gate called Mikolayska, where
they were challenged by the gatekeeper.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KRAKOW</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“C</span>harnetski, Christian,</span> wife and son,” said Pan
Andrew to a custodian who wore light armor and
carried a halberd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave them a quick glance and motioned for them to
pass. Another man in black peered into the cart to see what
was inside and, finding nothing, concluded that these were
farm folk come up to the city to buy, and accordingly demanded
but a few pieces of iron coin as tax. This paid, they took
the road which ran from Mikolayska Gate to the Sukiennice,
the old Cloth Hall, which stood then, as it does to-day, in the
very center of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Krakow was flooded with a golden sunlight. Joseph, who
saw for the first time a large city, gaped in very astonishment as
he glanced left and right about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Front and rear, their cart formed part of the long, straight
train of carts coming to the city loaded with products of the
farms. Through this line were breaking from time to time
splendid horsemen wearing breastplates of steel that shone
like precious metal and carrying long swords dangling from
the saddles. One of these men who pushed through the
crowd just in front of their horses was so splendidly arrayed
that the boy took him for a very high noble, or perhaps the
King himself, the peace-loving King, Kazimir Jagiello, the
fourth of the name of Kazimir, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/019.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0002' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be the King, father. See the shining armor
and the jewels upon his saddle. And the sword must be of
gold, for it shines like fire. And look,” he pointed eagerly,
“see the Polish eagle worked in silver upon the saddlecloth.
There beyond it is the white knight of Lithuania. Is he not
indeed the King?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, son, no. That is but one of the guard that waits on
the nobles at the royal castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All about them rose in the bright sunlight palaces, churches,
towers, battlement walls, and Gothic buildings, as yet for the
most part unadorned by the rich sculpture that was to come
in a few years under the influence of the Italian Renaissance.
In the distance rose against the turquoise-blue sky the cathedral
on the Wawel Hill, its Romanesque tower showing high
above the city. Close at hand were the two towers of the
Church of Our Lady Mary, not as they appear to-day since
the hand of the master architect and of the renowned sculptor,
Wit Stwosz, altered them, but rising unbelfried and uncrowned
above the cemetery, where white gravestones clustered at the
base of the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the very middle of the market, surrounded by smaller
wooden buildings, was the great Cloth Hall, used for the sale
and exchange of cloth goods, already swarming with merchants
who had been traveling all night, and for many
nights perhaps, in order to close bargains early on market
day before the money of purchasers had been, spent elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Camped in the square outside the Cloth Hall were a number
of Tartars who had come from the distant East to sell
fine swords and cloths and jewels plundered from Muscovites,
or Bulgarians, or Greeks, or other travelers in the steppes.
Facing the east as the rising sun had crept over Wawel Hill,
they had chanted their morning prayer of praise to the great
Allah. Their singing could have been heard mingling with the
clashing of the great bell on the Church of Our Lady Mary
and the chanted service of the Armenian merchants who had
come in from Trebizond and the lands beyond the Black Sea
with carpets and spices and fine rugs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here for the moment in this great international capital of
East and West was worshiped every god that man knows; it
might even be said that God himself was worshiped under
many names and in many languages and dialects. Here were
Turks, Cossacks, Ruthenians, Germans, Flemings, Czechs,
and Slovaks, with their wares to sell, and Hungarians with
their wines from the mellow plains of Transylvania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for money, there might be found zloty and guilder and
groschen, silver in bars and precious stones, also plenty of
token “in kind”; that is to say, certain varieties of merchandise
such as amber, dates bound in packages, or even vegetables
in containers, each of which had a recognized value over
all the trade routes of the Hanseatic League. For the League
merchants were represented here as well—prosperous Germans
or Dutchmen in long robes with fur collars—and they
did business in every language known to man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the boy drank in these unusual sights on all sides,
there suddenly floated down from above the sweet notes of a
trumpet. Looking directly upward he could see the golden
bell of a trumpet protruding from one of the tower windows
of the Church of Our Lady Mary, and as he looked the full
dignity of the church burst upon him, its quiet strength which
appealed to the eye being strangely mingled in his senses with
the trumpet song which fell upon his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two towers rising high above the traffic of the
street; rising unequally, he now noticed, for the nearer tower
seemed a bit squat beside the farther one. It was from the
higher tower that the trumpeter was playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tune was a little morning hymn, the Heynal, brought
into Poland, some said, in the earliest days of Christianity by
missionaries who came from the south. It was a simple little
air, intensely sweet and appealing, but at a certain place the
trumpeter broke the tune off abruptly, leaving but the echo of
an unfinished strain to float down from above. It was as if
some one at that moment had taken the trumpet from his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph turned to his father in astonishment. “Isn’t he going
to finish the song?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father smiled. “It is a long story, my son, and one
that I will tell you at a later time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trumpet sounded again from another window, then
from the farther side, and finally at the north side toward the
Florian Gate. Four times the trumpeter had sounded the
Heynal, ending always with the broken note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He plays rather poorly,” added Pan Charnetski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now though Pan Charnetski was a country gentleman, he
was accomplished in many crafts. After having graduated
from the University of Krakow, he decided not to remain in
one of the professions but rather to live on his father’s estate
and manage it as had been the custom for the men in his family.
He had retained a love of music which he had studied in the
University and played well upon brass instruments, the straight
trumpet, the curved trumpet, and the trumpet with keys.
Therefore when he said that the trumpeter in the tower had
not played well he knew of what he was talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cart was now passing close to the Cloth Hall, and
Joseph ceased to question his father any further concerning
the song with the broken note because of the strange scenes
which claimed his attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here stood a group of merchants in bright gowns.
Wealthy they must have been because their long coats were
of fine cloth, some lined with fur and trimmed with many
silks. Beneath the coats were costumes of tight-fitting cloth.
Joseph saw one man with the color of the cloth in the trouser
of the right leg different from the color of the cloth of the left
trouser, which to the boy had a ludicrous look. But when he
noticed that many other men wore the same kind of garment,
tight-fitting to leg and thigh, and of different color upon each
leg, he ceased to smile and began to wonder. The wonder did
not leave off for a while, either, for other curiosities in dress
caught his eye. The hats and head coverings were in their
way as remarkable as the tight garments. Turbans were
worn uniformly; some with pointed peaks, others simply
masses of gayly colored cloth heaped up high on the head in
twists and folds; grotesque ornaments, too, were worn on the
head—one man even had a stuffed or an imitation rooster,
with legs and comb and all, perched on the crown of his high
hat. The merchants wore curious leather footgear, most of
the sandals being of soft leather with long twisted points.
One man had sticks thrust into the leather at the toes, making
his sandals appear at least two feet long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the stalls around the Cloth Hall were all manner of wares
which the sellers were advertising with loud cries. Here was
a grain counter with different colored grains in open sacks. A
woman in a blue gown which hung from a yoke at the shoulder,
and with, a piece of cloth of the same color wound deftly
around her head for a hat, was selling a few grains of corn to
a traveling musician. He wore a long yellow garment all of
a piece, including head covering like a cowl, and falling to the
knees, below which the legs and feet were bare. This garment,
was caught at the waist by a bright yellow belt. He carried
under one arm a bagpipe with three protruding tubes, two for
music, if it might be called such, and one for his mouth. In
one hand he held a pouch of leather into which the woman was
slipping grains of corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charnetskis drove by the stalls and shops of the glove
makers where there were women working and buying, all
dressed in bright-colored gowns; past the needle makers in
leather aprons who sprawled over benches; past the sword
makers with their neat forges and rows of shining steel blades;
past the tub makers who were assembling wooden staves into
tub bodies; past the smiths in their long black aprons leading
horses into position where they could be shod. Here and there
the red signs of the barber and bloodletter, here and there the
huge flasks of green and blue denoting the stores of the apothecaries.
True Catholics had upon the walls of their shops an
ikon or a picture of the Holy Mother of God from the sacred
shrine of Chenstohova; almost every merchant had some distinctive
figure above the door of his shop to distinguish it from
his neighbor’s; for example there was a hatter with the sign
“Under the White Elephant,” and there was a shoemaker who
had a stone head of Kazimir the Great for the satisfaction of
himself and his customers. The numbering of public buildings
was not known in that age, and buildings were distinguished
by some such emblem which usually stood above the
outer gate or door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everywhere could be heard the cries of vendors shouting or
singing their wares or professions, the flower-girls, the knife
sharpener, the baker’s boy, and the butcher’s apprentice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Co brakuje, co brakuje</span>,” they all shouted in a chorus.
“What do you lack? What do you lack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally to Joseph’s delight, a monkey could be seen,
brought here by traders from the east or south, one playing
around a booth, another carried, much bedecked with ribbons,
in the arms of some merchant’s or perhaps burgomaster’s
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice amid the clamor of the market rang the
clanking of chains as poor wretches about to be fastened to the
church walls by iron collars, or stuck in the pillory, or perhaps
even to suffer a worse fate, were marched to the church for a
last prayer before the sentence of the law was passed upon
them. Life was a precarious thing in many ways in those
days, and men and women for very slight offenses were beheaded
or banished or thrown into terrible prisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they passed a procession of pilgrims on the way to
some shrine, men and women from the villages dressed in their
good clothes with the parish priest marching ahead of them
and leading the chant which they were singing. The cross
bearer was a young man with stalwart shoulders and bright
eyes; he had need of his strength, too, for he had sworn to
carry the holy image of Our Lord from his native village
to Chenstohova, which was many miles distant. This company
had already been on the road about ten days. There
were boys and girls, too, in the procession, and some had their
minds upon serious things, but others were looking for the
first time upon the glory of medieval Krakow, and would no
doubt in their prayers ask forgiveness for too much attention to
worldly things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cart turned into Grodzka or Castle Street after leaving
the market place and went directly toward the Wawel. Near
the Wawel Pan Andrew swung the horses to the right and
passed through a city gate and into a meadowy lane. In front
of a large rambling palace that stood there, he drew up by the
side of the road and leaped to the ground not far from a pair
of iron gates that marked the entrance. At these gates he
was accosted by an armed guard who, with a rather hostile air,
blocked the entrance completely with his spear.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/027.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seek Pan Andrew Tenczynski.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard shouted something, whereat five men in armor
came running from a little house near the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surround him,” said the guard. This was done, much to
the astonishment of Pan Andrew. “One of you run to the
house and call the captain,” next ordered the guard. “Tell him
that a countryman is here demanding to see Pan Andrew
Tenczynski.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Charnetski, trying to force his way out of the circle,
was pushed back into the center by one of the armed men. At
that he raised his voice in anger:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you that dare detain me here? I am Pan Andrew
Charnetski, first cousin to the Tenczynskis and proprietor
of an estate in the Ukraine. I demand that you confront
me with an officer in authority and not treat me like one come
here as an enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men of the guard looked at each other in astonishment.
Was it possible that this man did not know the truth—the
report of which had already spread over the greater portion
of Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain came in a moment with the returning soldier.
He broke through the ring and walked straight up to Pan
Charnetski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your business here?” There was a certain pleasantness
and courtesy in his voice that made Pan Andrew forget
his anger for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a civil tongue, young man,” he answered. “I
take it that you are in command here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will tell you, as I have told your soldiers, that I
am Pan Andrew Charnetski come this day from the Ukraine
to see my cousin Pan Andrew Tenczynski on important business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come too late,” answered the captain. “It is strange
that you have not heard, for this news is now all about the
country. Pan Andrew Tenczynski lives no longer. His kin
have departed from the city for a time, and may return, I
know not when. I am here for the observance of order, for
the protection of the estate against enemies of the family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew started. “My cousin is dead—and how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was like to nothing the city has seen these many years.
For a long time there had been hot blood between the tradesmen
and nobles. The issue came to a head through the dissatisfaction
of Pan Tenczynski over some piece of armor that he
had bidden a smith to make. He not only took the tradesman
to task but refused to pay for the work he had done, whereat
the whole guild rose against him. They pursued him through
the streets and killed him in the Church of the Franciscans
where he had sought shelter. It was a sad and grievous
thing, and his family for fear of the mob fled the city. The
gentle Elizabeth, our Queen—and may the blessing of Heaven
be upon her!—hates all strife that may result in the shedding
of blood, and she it was who persuaded our King to make
peace between the townsfolk and nobles. He sent us here to
protect this house, to be a guarantee against the shedding of
any blood, for there are many who would willingly pillage this
dwelling and kill the servants that are still here. We are but
acting upon orders when we detain all persons who seek entrance
here, and for the execution of these orders you must
give us your pardon, since we seek but to avert further bloodshed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/030.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Pan Andrew at that moment as if heaven had
fallen about his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me give to Pan one piece of advice,” continued the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most willingly will I receive it,” said Pan Andrew thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get yourself from the city as quickly as possible if you be
of any blood ties with the Tenczynskis, or else if you stay
change your name and manner of speech lest some assassin
make a mark of you for the benefit of his party.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I greet
you then with a hail, as is befitting between equal Pans, and
request that, for your own safety, you depart quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—I must remain here. A band of pillagers, I know
not whom exactly, though I think them the paid robbers of
some one in high authority, have burned my house in the
Ukraine and left not one stone upon another. My fields are
ruined as well, and I am here to take refuge with my kinsmen,
to bring them word of something very secret which must go at
once to the ears of the King himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas,” answered the captain, “I can give you but little
help. The King is at this moment in Torun where there are
said to be plans against the military order of the Knights of
the Cross—for he seeks there in the north peace at all odds.
When he will return I know not, perhaps in a month, perhaps
in a year. If you would await him here, I would, if I were
you, settle in this town and take another name. Later there
will come a retribution for these dark deeds against the Tenczynski
family, and there will be more crows about the gallows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saying which he turned away and called the guard again to
its post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew, however, stood motionless for a few seconds.
The thoughts fairly burned in his brain. His friends, protectors,
gone! The King away, he himself a fugitive here no
less than in the Ukraine. From every side enemies pressed
upon him, and what had he done to deserve such a fate? He
was in a predicament even without this complication, for here
he was in a great city where he had not a single friend. He
had but little money, for what he had gathered had been invested
year by year in his house and lands in the Ukraine.
There were his wife and his son to be put in a place of shelter,
and not only were the means lacking but there was even peril at
every hand. Behind him at the gates of the city had appeared
one foe—here in the city there were apparently many others.
What to do? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let God give.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There
would be something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aimlessly he got into the wagon, turned it about, and made
for the market again. There at least they might spend the
day, procure water for the horses, and buy a little of something
to eat. He found a place near one of the springs, unloosed
the horses with the help of his son, and let them crop
the short grass that grew near one edge of the market place,
watering them with buckets that he filled at the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until then did he seek comfort and counsel from his
wife, who had always been his solace at such times; throwing
himself down beside her on the wagon seat he told her the
story of his late discoveries, the absence of the King, the death
of his kinsman. For a second the woman’s heart quailed before
the fresh difficulties, but she forgot self at the look in her
husband’s face. Her quiet reply, “We will wait, for God is
in the waiting,” filled him with courage again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph, however, was at that age when no sky remains long
clouded. His heart had been beating fast with excitement
ever since the sight of the city’s towers had loomed before
them in the early morning, and his legs had been itching to
get out of the wagon and explore the place. He began by taking
a short excursion over to a little building near by, which at
first glance had seemed to be a market building, but, when he
approached it, proved to be a church with a low dome and
round side windows. Although the church was of much interest
to those who favored historical lore as being one of the
oldest churches in Poland, it did not interest the boy greatly.
He scrutinized the beggars at the door, a young boy with but
one leg, a woman with a back bent to a curve, an old man with
sightless eyes, praying continually, and many other wretched
alms seekers. Crossing himself and muttering a prayer for
God’s helpless creatures, Joseph turned and marched down
Grodzka Street in the direction of the Wawel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had just come to a cross lane which led on the left to
the Church of the Dominicans, and on the right to the Church
of All Saints, when he noticed a Tartar boy in the street leading
and constantly beating a large Ukrainian wolf dog. The
wolf dog was on a leash—he had a strong hand-wrought collar
about the neck—and he was turning now and then to glance
back at his tormentor who was plying a short Cossack whip.
Joseph watched the boy in amazement, wondering why he had
the dog and why he was beating him—as a matter of fact the
boy was acting out of pure viciousness—but neither of these
questions found satisfactory solution in Joseph’s mind. In a
very few minutes, however, another question rose with the
suddenness of lightning, a question which required action for a
solution, and this action Joseph was able to supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For at the moment that the boy and dog were crossing the
church lane, there emerged from the farther footwalk a man
dressed all in black like a priest, but wearing a collar which
was not clerical since it opened in the front. He did not,
however, for the moment attract Joseph’s attention; it was
his companion that caught and held the boy’s gaze. For the
companion was a girl of perhaps the same age as Joseph—she
was walking by the side of the man in black and now and then
grasping at his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph saw the dog no longer. His eyes were riveted on
the girl. She seemed to him like an angel taken out of a Christmas
play, or a spirit from a Festival of the Three Kings—in
truth she might have been one of those beautiful figures come
to life out of the wondrous stained glass windows in the church.
Her hair was light—Joseph’s was dark. Her skin was as white
as the finest linen, her eyes as blue as the skies above the Vistula;
she wore a cloaklike garment of red that fell from her
shoulders to her ankles and was girdled at the waist. It was
embroidered in blue, with lace at neck and wrists; in front it
did not meet completely but showed the second garment that
she wore beneath, a mantle of blue that fell in folds even below
the outer coat. And as she looked up, the country boy
thought that he had never seen anything prettier on earth—so
daintily she tripped along that she seemed to walk on clouds.
Then for a moment he looked down at his hands, dirty, hard,
and grimy; he looked at his clothes and found them dusty and
worn after the long journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if he had been in heaven at the sight of the girl, he came
back to earth quickly. For the Tartar boy with the dog and
the man in black with the girl were close together at the crossing
of the roads when suddenly the maddened dog turned desperately
at bay upon his tormentor and crouched for a powerful
spring. Joseph shouted and rushed forward just as the
dog leaped. The Tartar boy dropped the leather thong in a
flash and darted down the walk out of reach of the dog’s jaws,
but leaving directly in his path the man in black and the girl
Blind with fury the dog sprang again, and in an instant he
would have come down upon the girl who happened to be on
the outside, had not Joseph at the same moment leaped and
caught at the dog’s heavy collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had dealt with dogs many times in the Ukraine, and he
knew that no dog is vicious if healthy and well treated; therefore
there had been no fear in this effort that he made, save for
the peril, perhaps, that the dog might mistake him for the
boy who had been beating him, and sink his teeth into his flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His fingers caught the collar squarely. The grip held, and
he went hurtling through the air like the tail of a skyrocket,
as the dog’s leap, weighted by this unexpected load, fell short,
and the girl drew back with a cry. But Joseph and the infuriated
animal went rolling to and fro in a wild embrace on the
hard surface of the road, he striving to make the beast pay attention
to his words, the dog only becoming more and more
frightened. But the boy knew, after the first second when all
depended upon whether his grip held or not, that everything
was safe and he could successfully avoid the paws and teeth of
the dog. Thus at a favorable moment he released his hold
quickly upon the animal’s collar, and scrambled to his feet,
while a very dusty and possibly ashamed wolf dog tore off like
a streak of lightning in the direction of the Franciscans’
church.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ALCHEMIST</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>omething</span> heavy but kindly fell upon Joseph’s
shoulders and something light touched his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking up quickly from a survey of his garments,
now more ragged and dusty than ever, he perceived that the
weight was the hand of the man in black and that the lightness
had been a kiss upon his cheek from the man’s companion,—her
cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright and her lips
were still close to him. He was somewhat dazed from the
shock of going to earth so quickly with the dog, but he thrilled
with pleasure and happiness from the kindly touch and the kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped back to brush himself, and then gazed squarely
at the man and girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His cheeks grew rosy with that first meeting of eyes. For
in the man’s there was an ocean of gratitude and a suggestion
of a tear, and the girl’s eyes blazed forth frank admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were so quick,” she exclaimed. “Would that I could
spring like that. It was brave of you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tongue found no words. Boys of fifteen, even if aged
by experience, have little to say when praise is bestowed so
freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover the man gave him no opportunity. “Remarkable,”
he said, “remarkable. As swift a leap as I ever saw,”
and then blinking with his eyes as if the light hurt them, added,
“or hope to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was nothing,” Joseph stammered. “Often in the
Ukraine I have dispersed dogs in a fight.” And then thinking
that this perhaps sounded like boasting, said further, “As do
many boys of my age in that country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the Ukraine?” The man in black looked at
him with interest. “How do you happen to be so far from
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tartars or Cossacks burned our house. We have been
traveling this day more than two weeks in a cart only to find
ourselves homeless here. Father had kinsfolk in this city, but
the head of the house is dead and the others are away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are your people now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the market place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” the man muttered to himself, “homeless and in the
market place. And what will they do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy shook his head. “I think that my father will find
us some shelter,” he said finally. “He was thinking——” He
hesitated for he had been taught never to speak of troubles
before strangers, though the girl peered straight into his eyes
with great kindness and sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is something curious here,” thought the man. “The
boy’s face has a high degree of intelligence and his speech is
the speech of one who has listened to good words. A noble
action this—I think in good faith that the whelp might have
had his teeth in the child’s throat.” Looking down upon the
boy he said, “You have rendered us a noteworthy service, you
have saved my niece from much painful injury; will you not
accompany us to our home that we may hear your whole story
and perhaps in our turn——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy’s face reddened. “Nay,” he said, “I wish no reward.
What I did——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl caught him up. “Indeed you do my uncle wrong.
He meant but this: we live humbly, will you not come and
rest for a moment until you may join your people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask pardon,” the boy said quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereat the man laughed, for their speech and expression
had been over-serious for children, though it still was an age
when children grew to be men and women often over a single
night. In some provinces girls of fourteen or fifteen were
considered grown women and even given in marriage. Boys
at that age had seen much of the rough side of life, of war
and battle and cruelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go with you,” Joseph added, kissing the cuff of the
gown of the man in black as he had always been taught to do
in his home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned to the left past the Church of the Franciscans,
to the right through a short lane, and then to the left again
into the most curious street of the world of that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Street of the Pigeons, famed throughout all Europe
as the dwelling place of scholars, astrologers, magicians,
students, and likewise doctors, brothers of the Church, and
masters of the seven arts. In the worst end of the street, the
upper end near the city wall, clustered the squalid dwelling
places that were once the homes of Jewish refugees, fleeing
from persecution in all parts of the world. Terrible poverty
had existed there, and when the Jewish inhabitants finally
moved to their own city, Kazimierz, across the river, the buildings
which they left were scarcely fit for human beings to live
in. They were, in the first place, very old and out of repair—they
were built for the most part of wood, though the fronts
on the street were sometimes of brick covered with rough
cement or mortar. The upper stories usually overhung, and
the roofs were covered with loose boards nailed in place,
serving instead of tiles or shingles. Rickety staircases on the
outsides of these buildings led from the street or from interior
courts up to the dwelling places on the third and fourth floors,
where, at the time of this story, lived family literally heaped
upon family in terrible disorder and poverty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thieves and murderers crouched there in hiding during the
day, bands of lawless men had their haunts there in cellar
or attic or other den. A fire in the year 1407 had swept
through this street and through St. Ann’s, clearing out
many of these undesirable places, but unfortunately not destroying
all of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the lower end of the street on the side toward the University
of Krakow there was more respectability since students
and masters of the university inhabited there. A large students’
<span class='it'>bursar</span> or dormitory stood near the corner where
Jagiellonska now meets the Street of the Pigeons. In this
lived many students; others put up near by in groups or with
private families, since it was not until late in the 1490’s that
the authorities compelled the students to live in university
buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prestige of the various colleges and the reputation of
the men who taught there had drawn to Krakow not only genuine
students but also many of the craft that live by their wits
in all societies, in all ages—fortune tellers and astrologers,
magicians and palmists, charlatans, necromancers, and fly-by-nights
who were forever eluding the authorities of the
law. Here somewhere on the Street of the Pigeons they all
found lodging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the rooms above the street, in the kitchens beneath the
street, these men plied their trades. Self-termed astrologers
read in the stars the destinies of the gullible; they foretold happiness
to trusting peasant girls who came to them for advice
in their love matters, they prophesied disaster to merchants
who, held by fear, might be induced to part with much money;
they cheated, they robbed, and often on provocation they
killed, until after many years they gave the street a certain
unsavory reputation. Against the machinations of these
men the influence of the university was ever working, and
the first great blow that many of these magic crafts and black
arts received was struck by Nicholas Kopernik, better known
as Copernicus, many years later when Joseph Charnetski
was a very old man; Copernicus, working with rough implements,
even before the telescope had been invented, proved
to men for the first time that the heavenly bodies, stars and
planets, move in the skies according to well-fixed and definitely
determined laws, subject only to the will of the Creator
of the universe, and that they have nothing to do with the
destinies of individuals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All about them in the street flitted men dressed in long
robes like that of the guardian of the little girl, though all the
robes were not alike. Some were clerical with closed front and
collar, others were open and flowing with great sleeves like a
bishop’s gown, some were of blue, some were of red, some
were of green. Joseph noticed one robe of ermine over which
was worn a chain of heavy gold, at the end of which hung
suspended a great amethyst cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed a house, part wood and part stone, where were
gathered at opened doors a great group of young men in plain
black robes, much less sumptuous than some others which
they had seen, all the members of the group engaged in a
lively altercation, as the guardian informed the boy and girl,
concerning the movement of the stars. One was contending
that the firmament of stars moved for one hundred
years to the west—another (and this was backed by a
written argument from the old Alphonsian tables from
Spain) that the stars moved constantly in one direction without
change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing this group they came to a dwelling, the front of
which was stone. The door was set back from the street
and flanked by short projecting buttresses on either side,
put there as if to caution the emerging inhabitant to look
carefully to right and left before proceeding—a caution not
unwise at night. The windows above were not only crossed
by wooden shutters that opened and closed like doors, but
also barred with iron. The man in black took from the
folds of his gown a huge brass key, which he fitted into the
outside door, turned it in the lock with some labor, and then
threw the portal open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stepped over a small board which served as a
threshold, and passed through a dark passageway which led
to an open court. At the end of the court was the flat wall
of a monastery, without windows or doors. On the right
was a low, one-story building, and on the left rose a ramshackle
structure of wood, four stories high. Outside this
building, leading to the apartments on the second and third
floors, was a wooden staircase hitched to the wall by wooden
clutch supports and strengthened by a single wooden upright.
In the middle of the court was an old well with a bucket on a
rope attached to a wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The staircase creaked as they ascended, and seemed to
Joseph to swing just a little. It gave him such a dizzy
sensation that he clutched at the wall, fearful lest the
whole structure should become loose and topple down.
But the man only smiled as he saw the boy’s sudden movement
and assured him that the staircase was safe enough. They
went up one flight past the first landing, and then on to the
second. Here they stopped and the man reached into his
gown for another key, a smaller one this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as they were entering the apartment on the third floor
opposite this landing, Joseph noticed that there was still one
more floor above them even though the main staircase ended
with the third floor. The entrance to this top floor, which
appeared to have been at one time a loft or storeroom, was
gained by climbing a crude, ladderlike staircase with a single
rail, which was fastened at a slight angle against the wall.
The door to which these steps led was directly above the
farther end of the landing, and to Joseph’s surprise appeared
to be of metal. From its shape and size the boy decided
that it was a window that had been changed into an entrance,
while at its right a square aperture had been cut in the wall
probably for the purpose of giving light. In an instant they
were in the apartment where the man and girl lived, and
Joseph had no further chance to study the loft which in some
unexplainable manner had aroused his curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This apartment was stuffy and poorly lighted, but the
furnishings were not poor. There were tapestries and great
oaken chairs, a heavy table in the middle of the room, several
huge chests, and a sideboard upon which some silver glistened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl ran quickly to a shutter and threw it open, whereupon
the light streamed in through a myriad of small glass
panes set in lead. Quickly she set before Joseph and the
man in black, small goblets which she filled with wine; a few
pieces of broken bread were placed before them on the table,
and they all ate, Joseph rather voraciously, although striving
to disguise his hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now tell us your story,” the man bade him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph related it briefly, emphasizing for the most part
the arrival of his father and mother and himself in the city
that morning, and the dilemma that faced them in procuring
lodgings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the black robe listened attentively, and when
the boy had finished he struck the table a light blow. “I
think I have it,” he said. “Wait here for me and take what
refreshment you will. I will be back in a few moments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went out through the door and hurried down the stairs
to one of the apartments below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl pushed her chair closer to Joseph’s and looked
up into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your name?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Joseph Charnetski.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joseph,” she said. “I like the name much. Mine is
Elzbietka.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father is Andrew Charnetski,” continued Joseph, “and
we lived in the country of the black lands in the Ukraine. It
was lonely in our neighborhood, for the nearest neighbor
was sixty staja away, yet we never felt fear of Cossack or
Tartar, though others did, for my father always treated them
well. We were therefore surprised not long ago when there
came to us a former servant, a friendly Tartar, who said
that we were in some danger, and although my father laughed,
I know that he gave the report some credence since he took
the Tartar aside and talked with him privately for a long
time. He is not one to reveal his fear, however, and we remained
in our house as before with the warning all but forgotten
by my mother and me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then one night before we went to bed, my mother, who
was working upon some sewing, saw a man’s face peeping in
through the thatch at one corner of our house. It was a face
that she had never seen before; it was not one of the servants
of our place or any place next to ours; it was a villainous face
and it made such an impression on her that she screamed
aloud, alarming us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” the blue eyes were full of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That night my father came into the room where I was
sleeping, bade me dress quickly, and in a short time led me
and my mother through a little door in the rear of the house
that I had never seen opened before, since it had always been
fastened with nails. Outside this door we found ourselves in
a passageway dug out of the earth like a cave, and through
this we crept until we emerged into a shed some distance
from the other dwellings where two of our best horses
were hitched to a cart. That my father had already
taken such precautions unknown to us assured me that he
had feared something, the nature of which he had kept
from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay—the most curious part is yet to come. My mother
and I climbed into the wagon where a goodly supply of food
had been stored, while my father, moving swiftly, wielded
a forked stick with such effect, in one corner of the shed,
that he soon unearthed a pile of vegetables which had been
covered over with tree branches and leaves in order to preserve
them. I thought at the time that he was about to
put some of them into our wagon for food, but to my surprise
he chose only one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pumpkin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>pumpkin</span>! But why——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know no more about it than you. When everything else
in our wagon had been eaten, father refused to give it up—this
was ten days later, of course, when we were on the last
stages of our journey; and once, indeed this very morning,
a man who had evidently pursued us from the Ukraine offered
my father the pumpkin’s weight in gold in exchange for it—but
my father refused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you learn whose face your mother saw in the thatch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I did not, but what came later proved that my father
had acted wisely in leaving our house secretly and in a hurry.
For when we stopped in a village a few days later to rest
our horses, we saw a neighbor who had traveled from our
part of the country on horseback. He had passed our place
on the day after we left. Every building had been burned
to the ground, he told us, and the land itself looked as if
a battle had raged there; the wheat was down and the crops
were burnt, and holes had been dug everywhere as if the
invaders had hunted for hidden treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father has the pumpkin now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is safe in his possession—though why he refused its
weight in gold I cannot see. But I think he would not be
pleased that I have told all this about it, although I know that
the secret is safe with you. Now tell me something of
yourself. This man whom you called uncle—is he your
father’s brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That he is. My mother and father died in the plague
that spread through the town when I was small. He is a
Master of Arts in the university and a very great scholar,”
she added proudly. “His name is Nicholas Kreutz and among
those most famed in the university in alchemy he is indeed the
greatest. He is not a servant of the Church, though a good
Christian, and he seeks, as do many others, the secrets of his
craft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scholar-alchemist appeared suddenly in the doorway
and smiled at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just ascertained,” he said, seating himself at the
table, “that if it pleases your father there is a haven for you
all here in this very house. There is not much to pay, and
a shelter, however lowly, is better than the sky when night
falls. Your father might sell his pair of horses—horses
bring a good price at present, I hear—and he could live here
until some suitable employment appears. Unless,” he added,
“the place is too humble——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed that cannot be,” said the boy eagerly. “Gladly
at this minute will he welcome any roof for the sake of my
mother who is somewhat tired after the long journey from the
Ukraine. I cannot go too swiftly to tell him of this news.
But only assure me that you are in sober earnest about this
matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elzbietka sprang up from her chair. “Did you but know
him as well as I, you would not doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the alchemist enveloped her with his long arms
from which hung the black sleeves of his gown, until she
smiled out from the embrace at Joseph like one caught between
the wings of a great raven or crow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry and tell your people,” she commanded him, “and
bring them back here. Indeed, I never knew what a mother
was. If I but please her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you will,” shouted Joseph. “I will go as soon as
Pan Kreutz unlocks the door for me below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell your people that it is the floor beneath us that is
unoccupied,” directed the alchemist as he let the boy out
through the gate. “There are only two rooms there, a large
and a small one, but they will serve your purposes for the
time, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph thanked him with all his heart and set out on the
run for the market place. The Street of the Pigeons seemed
to unwind before him as he ran and he was soon in the street
leading directly to the Cloth Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning there, past one corner of the Town Hall, he
ran directly by the cloth markets and headed for the little
church near which his father had unloosed the horses. But
no sooner had his eyes fallen upon the wagon and his father
and mother standing in it, than he stopped suddenly in
astonishment. Then like an arrow leaving a bow he darted
forward, for what he saw set his heart beating faster than
it had beaten in all that eventful day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger that they had left in the mud by the roadside
that morning stood by the side of the wagon with a crowd
of ruffians at his heels threatening and shouting at Pan Andrew
and his wife. The stranger carried a huge club, and
the ruffians, of whom he appeared to be the leader, were
armed with staves and stones and were shouting angrily as
if intent on harming the man and woman above them. Pan
Andrew, in facing them, had stepped in front of his wife,
to shield her if stones were thrown; and the sight of the
resistance, and the cries of the leader and his attackers, soon
brought a huge crowd surging about the wagon, for it was
now close on to noon, and the morning’s business of the
market was well-nigh finished and many citizens and farmers
were eating or resting in the shade of the trees about the
square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph darted through the crowd and leaped up on the
wagon, to stand by his father’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, we have the cub as well,” shouted the one who had
boasted of the name Ostrovski in the early morning. “He
is a wizard like unto the father, and a witch like the mother,
for it was he who made my horse fly straight up to heaven
this morning with a blow upon the flank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that a great skulk in the crowd let fly a stone at the three
which missed Pan Andrew but narrowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Magicians, wizards, witches,” hooted the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the man who is the worst,” shouted the self-named
Ostrovski. “It is he who hath bewitched my brother and cut
off his head and changed the head into a pumpkin. If he be
honest, let him deliver that pumpkin over to me in the sight
of all, that I may give Christian burial to my brother’s brains.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An’ he will not, let him face my charge. He is a wizard,
yea, and one condemned by church and court and precept. At
him! Kill him! But save me the pumpkin which is the head
of my brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Absurd as these accusations seem to-day, they did not
seem so in the fifteenth century. For men were then but
beginning to see the folly of many superstitions and cruelties
that had been prevalent since the Dark Ages; they believed
that certain persons had malign powers such as could transform
others into strange animals; they thought that by magic
men could work out their spite upon others in horribly malicious
ways; that food could be poisoned by charms and milk
made sour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to raise the cry of wizard against a man, no matter
how peace-loving and innocent he might be, was enough to
start rough and brutal men, yes, and women, too, into active
persecution and unlawful deeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the method that the stranger had adopted in
order to get his revenge upon Pan Andrew, and not only
revenge, but that which he sought even more keenly, the
possession of the pumpkin that the country gentleman had
refused to deliver to him early in the day. He had been
about the city seeking out certain friends or followers in order
to raise the cry of wizard, and then he had with them searched
through the city until they came upon Pan Andrew and his
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pumpkin, the pumpkin—it is my brother’s head,” he
kept shouting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew, on his side, only smiled back derisively upon
him, and gathered in the pumpkin where no man could seize
it without taking as well a blow from his heavy sword, and
the attackers, being more cowards than men, made no attempt
to approach the wagon at the side that he was facing. Some
armed with large stones were, however, sneaking around to
get behind him, and others in front were preparing to send
a volley of missiles upon him, when there rushed into the
turmoil a man of venerable appearance, clad in a brown
robe with large puffy sleeves and pointed hood. He was of
moderate stature, firm of gait, and bore himself like a man
in the prime of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A priest he might have been, a brother of some order
he seemed, but a scholar he was certainly, for there was that
in his face and a droop to the shoulders that proclaimed him
a man of letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cease—cease—cowards all!” he shouted in a commanding
tone of voice. “What persecution goes on here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man and the woman and boy are workers in magic,
wizards and a witch,” said the leader roughly. “Keep your
hands off, for we are admonishing them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wizards and witches—fiddlesticks!” shouted the newcomer,
pulling himself up in the wagon until he stood beside
Pan Andrew. “This is but an excuse for some such deed of
violence as this city has seen too much of in the past twelve
months. To attack an honest man—for to any but a blind
man he appears as honest—a weak woman, and a defenseless
boy—Cowards all, I say! Disperse, or I will call the King’s
guards to disperse you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Jan Kanty himself,” said one of the rioters in a loud
whisper that all about him heard. “I’m off, for one.” And
throwing his stick to the ground he took to his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there had been no magic in Pan Andrew, his wife, or his
boy, there was magic in the name of Jan Kanty, and a very
healthy magic, too, for at once every hat in that crowd came
off, and men began to look askance at each other as if caught
in some shameful thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good Jan Kanty,” was whispered on every side, and
in the briefest second imaginable the crowd had melted until
there remained not one person, not even the leader of the
ruffians who had begun the attack.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GOOD JAN KANTY</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>mong</span> the most remarkable personages of Krakow’s
age of glory in the fifteenth century was a certain
scholar-priest by the name of Jan Kanty. He had
been educated at the University of Krakow in the period of
late Scholasticism when the chief teachings were still mere
expositions of the Seven Arts of which Grammar was the
king. However, a full life and much contact with men had
made Jan Kanty a well-rounded man. He loved learning
for its own sake, but he honored most of all its precepts and
its application to life, and he gave himself over in his cell-like
quarters on the lower floor of the old University building,
now long since destroyed by fire, to the creation of new
points of view on old subjects, to comments on the conduct
and opinions of the masters and doctors of the university
at the great church councils of Europe, and to an intellectual
chronicle of his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His life was saintly and his cell was as much visited, perhaps,
as is his shrine in the magnificent old university library
to-day. The peasants loved him especially, and this was
rather curious since the men from the farms rarely sought
the advice of the men of the university; they were, in fact,
somewhat shy of the dispensers of higher learning. They
were not shy of Jan Kanty, however. They came to Krakow
to ask his opinion on the weather in the seasons of grains and
vegetables, they called upon him for decisions in disputes
between landowners, they consulted him concerning the proper
kind of food for their live stock, they questioned him on all
problems having to do with morals or religion, and they
accepted his rulings with as much finality and satisfaction as
if they had been the rulings of Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore his name was one to be reckoned with everywhere,
inside the city and out. He hated above all things
cruelty of man against man, or of man against something helpless,
a horse, or a dog, or a child. And when he saw one
man and a woman and a boy of honest features and good
appearance harassed by some hundred men, he did not hesitate
but rushed into the midst of the flying stones without regard
to his own safety or comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace be with you,” he said to Pan Andrew when the
crowd had scattered, “and with you, my daughter,” putting
his hand upon the woman’s head. “What may be the cause
of such mischance? You are strangers here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strangers and worse. Homeless,” said Pan Andrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are come from a long distance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Ukraine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kind shoulders rocked in agitation. “My—my—but
surely you have friends in town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have none. I had a friend here and sought him, but he
is dead. My house is burned by Tartars, my wealth is gone.
I am pursued by men who seek my life and the one possession
that I have left.” Here he touched the pumpkin with his
foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why this accusation of magic?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew smiled. “A trick it was to raise feelings
against me in the public square and then to despoil me of this
possession. I think that he who raised the storm against
me here has followed me many miles across the border, and
I believe that he is the agent of some more powerful person.
There is much to this, my good—my good—— You are a
priest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/053.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Men call me so. I am but a servant of the Father of
us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, good father, hear me! I seek to do no man wrong.
I am helpless in a world of plotting and troubles and I seek
only a place where I may this night provide shelter for my
good wife and my boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me then,” said the scholar-priest. “I will at
least offer you the hospitality that my cell affords.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nay—hitch
your horses to the wagon and drive through that lane
yonder which leads to the Street of St. Ann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew was already adjusting the harnesses when
Joseph tugged at his sleeve. “Father,” he urged, “father,
I know of a place where we can stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father looked down at him in astonishment. “You,”
he answered, “you? And how did you find such a place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A scholar and his niece live there. They took me
to their house. There is a space below them at the head of
a flight of stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Kanty interposed. “Come at any rate to my dwelling,
and there we can make plans. If the boy has found a place,
and his face and words seem truthful, then we can talk at
better length there at our ease than here in the busy square.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later they stopped in front of the largest
of a number of buildings which made up the university.
On the way there Joseph had noted that almost every man
they passed on the street had doffed his hat to Jan Kanty,
and once a whole company of knights had saluted him with
drawn swords. He seemed to pay but little attention to these
courtesies, however, for his mind was busy with the problem
of the present, and when he alighted from the cart and led
the three to his little cell on the ground floor just at the right
of the door, he was still pondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once inside the house, however, Pan Andrew, disregarding
Joseph’s information for the minute, begged an immediate
audience with Jan Kanty alone, and while the boy and his
mother were eating some food which the scholar had placed
upon a table in the corridor just outside his cell, he began
to address his host in a low tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their voices buzzed as Joseph and his mother ate. Only
once did the boy catch distinct syllables, and that was when
the priest asked Pan Andrew, “That, then, is the pumpkin
that you have brought from the Ukraine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew must have nodded, for he made no verbal
answer. He had not dropped the precious vegetable from
his hands during the entire conversation. Joseph heard no
more of the talk, for he began at that moment to tell his
mother of his own adventures of the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he progressed with his story she ceased eating and
stared at him. “Why, this is a very miracle,” she said. “As
soon as Pan Andrew has finished with the good father in
the next room, we will go straight about procuring the lodging
of which the scholar told you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the poor child—she
lost her father and mother in the plague? Indeed, I
think that God must have sent us to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Kanty at the farther end of the cell listened to Pan
Andrew’s tale to the very end. He asked a few questions
which the other answered and then the two began to converse
rapidly though in low tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Jan Kanty passed his hand across his eyes as if
thinking very deeply. Then he said, “It seems to me that
there is one course open to you. You have enemies in the city,
you believe, and therefore you must remain for the present
unseen. I advise a change of name, for such subterfuge is
no sin where the end to be gained is righteous. For your
present needs you can obtain money by selling your horses
and cart; if you wish I will send a man with them to the
horse market in the plain below the Wawel. They would be
but an encumbrance to you at best, and moreover they will
bring a pretty price since they are of good stock and well fed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This money will not last me forever,” said Pan Andrew.
“I must think of some employment besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have thought of that,” continued Jan Kanty. “I know
of employment which might suit your case even though it
be a humble task.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be too humble for me,” answered the other
quickly, “provided it brings enough return for the support
of my wife and boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Excellent!” exclaimed the scholar. “Then I have
just the thing. You were a hunter in the old days, I presume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes,” said Pan Andrew, wondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you can sound the horn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I can. And if I do say it, with more skill than any
hunter in the Eastern Marches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But yet one thing. This news which you have
imparted to me should be for the ears of the King alone.
The treasure which you guard should be returned to him,
it should become the property of the commonwealth. I know
not what harm it has already done in the world; I only hope
that it may do no more. Would you leave it with me for
safe-keeping, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would that I could. But it was the oath that I took
to my father that it should never leave my hands while life
remained—save to one person, and that person, the King of
Poland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then God be with you. Rest here until the horses are sold
and then after hearing your son’s story we will think of
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called the mother and boy into his cell. “Why, here,”
he said on hearing the story of Joseph’s adventure from his
mother’s lips, “is the thing arranged to perfection. I know
the place you mention and I know the scholar Kreutz as well.
A curious man, and of certain strange disposition, but honest
and sincere and a seeker after light. He is, I think, feared
by the common people as are also many dwellers in the next
street which has been since olden times inhabited by sorcerers
and their ilk, and the court of his house is but little frequented.
They tell strange tales of him, sometimes, most
of which I know to be false. But it is just the place for your
dwelling at present, since there is little likelihood of your being
disturbed there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this so great a feeling of thankfulness came upon
Joseph’s mother that she would have fallen to her knees and
asked the good father for his blessing, but he restrained her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, daughter,” he said, “it is I who need thy blessing,
since I know what fortitude and courage thy kind heart
possesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed his hand nevertheless, as did Joseph immediately
afterward, and Pan Andrew turned away quickly lest they
should see that his eyes were moist, for there is such power in
kindness well bestowed that it touches the wells of human
feeling. There was, too, something in this scholar-priest
that went at once to the heart, some fine quality of feeling
and spirituality that set him apart, though ever so sweetly
and gently, from other men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A servant of the university was dispatched to sell the horses
and cart, and Joseph with his father and mother sat down
to await the man’s return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they were waiting, there came a knocking upon the
outside door. Jan Kanty went to it at once. A woman stood
there, with a baby in her arms, not in the attitude of one asking
for alms but of one seeking advice. She came, it seemed,
from the Black Village and was suffering much from pains that
took her legs and arms and neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Kanty questioned her quietly. “Where do you sleep?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the floor, reverend sir,” she answered. “And the aches
and pains are so strong that I can stand them no longer. It
is certain that a devil possesses me and I would that you
should pray him away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the floor made of stones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the stones ever wet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, reverend sir, except in spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the earth damp beneath the stones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—yes—perhaps,” she said. “Sometimes when the
well water is not much used it overflows, for there is a source
there, and sometimes when they have been drawing water
carelessly the overflow leaks down beneath the stones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then take heed to what I say and the aches and pains will
pass. Take stones and build a low wall between the well and
the side of your cottage. Make this waterproof and then
dig a drain that will carry the water away from your house.
Hang your bedclothes often in the sun and be sure that they
are always dry. Change every week the boughs upon which
you lie; thus will the pains go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed his hand and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a peasant who complained that worms were
coming up from the ground and were destroying the young
shoots of his plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you but say a prayer, father,” the man supplicated,
“the worms will cease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for you to prevent them,” said Jan Kanty. “Sprinkle
all the earth about the plants with ashes which you take
from your stove. If this does not prevent the worms, then
rise early in the morning and pour water about the plants.
The worms will then come to the top where the water is and
you may kill them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then stooping over a high desk he began to write upon
a long scroll of parchment, the end of which hung far over
the desk almost to the floor. He used for writing the quill
of a pigeon thrust into a piece of oak wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph curled up on a bench that ran along beneath the
windows and closed his eyes. What a day it had been! And
what might the future hold?</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts, which at first had begun to run slowly, suddenly
became brisk and grew fantastic. He seemed to see
himself bearing armor, a shield, and a sword, fighting desperately
with a great dark-browed Tartar who had instead
of a head a huge yellow pumpkin. Then the Tartar suddenly
took off his head, and carrying it in his arms, climbed up a
steep ladder to a room that seemed to hang from the stars.
Out of it came lightning and flashes of strangely colored light,
and suddenly the Tartar emerged, now with the head of a dog,
and the pumpkin floating along beside him as if it were but a
ball of feathers in the wind. The scratching of Jan Kanty’s
quill grew fainter and fainter, and the fantastic world dimmed
slowly in blackness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he awoke the room was no longer filled with sunshine.
A single candle lantern was burning at the farther end
of the cell and by its light he could see his father, Jan Kanty,
and his mother busied with something that lay in front of
them upon the table. He rubbed his eyes to make sure that
he was awake—yes, it was the mysterious pumpkin from which
his father was slicing away the outer rind with a huge knife.
It was a curious pumpkin, that vegetable—the rind was so
hard and brittle that the knife scraped on it as if it were
cutting or whittling away a piece of board. Joseph, fascinated,
watched the process, almost afraid to breathe. Little
by little the hard pieces dropped to the floor like bits of shell
as the blade cut them through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” the father was saying in a low voice, “that I hold
here in my hand the reason for the attack on my house in the
Ukraine, and that the man who has hounded us to-day knew
very well what this pumpkin shell contained. He had been
told that I had it in my possession; he knew the exact size of
my property, and he quickly put two and two together when
he saw this pumpkin, and only this pumpkin, in my wagon.
The reason that I made no effort to conceal it was, of course,
to allay any suspicion concerning it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” interrupted Jan Kanty, “a pumpkin at this time of
year is likely to create some curiosity among those who give
the matter a second thought. This is a late pumpkin, and I
suppose that in all Poland it would be hard to find another
such in midsummer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” replied Pan Andrew, “but I had to risk that. Long
ago when I was worried over this sacred charge and feared
lest some enemy might discover its existence and attempt to
rob me, there came to me the idea of a shell like this as an
excellent means of concealment. Since that day there has
never been a time, summer or winter, when there was not a
pumpkin shell in readiness for an emergency, and many an experiment
was I obliged to make, indeed, before I was able to
preserve a shell in the good condition of this one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment he cut away the last piece of the rind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was suddenly filled with the light of a thousand
candles. Colors of the rainbow fell upon the walls—a huge
center of radiance like the sun in the heavens blazed into
being at the very place where the pumpkin shell had been but
a moment before. Flickering, dancing flecks of light leaped
about the room and transformed its gloom into the brilliancy
of day—and then there was again but the light of the little
lantern, for the father had placed that which the pumpkin contained
in a bag furnished by Jan Kanty, and was busy tying up
the open side when Joseph came rushing up to the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” he cried, “what was it? What was the light
which came from that which you took from the pumpkin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father’s voice was kindly but firm. “In time, Joseph,
you shall know. It would be but a care to you, a matter of
more worry than you suspect, if you knew what responsibility
we are carrying here. If it is mere curiosity, be assured that
knowledge will bring nothing but pain. If it is real interest,
I will tell you plainly that in due time you shall be informed of
all that has passed. Just now—it has cost me so much that I
have not the heart to burden your young life with its secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, and, after a short silence, changed the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will go now to that place which you have found for
us. While you slept the reverend father and I have been to
see your friends. He has seen to it that the rooms have been
made comfortable, and there we shall stay, at least for the
present.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN THE STREET OF THE PIGEONS</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>t. Ann’s Street</span> was as black as pitch when they
emerged from the habitation of the scholar-priest. He
insisted on accompanying them and carried his little
candle lantern for aid, which, though it threw a faint light
upon the ground a step or two ahead, yet had not much more
light than the stars which shone down from a moonless sky.
Pan Andrew with his wife on his right arm followed Jan
Kanty, and Joseph brought up the rear. They had taken but
a few steps along the narrow footwalk by the side of the road,
when something damp and clammy was forced into the boy’s
right hand; he gave a little startled jump, but reassured himself
at the next minute that it was nothing but the nose of a
stray dog that had sought his hand as a token of friendly
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as I live,” thought Joseph as he reached down and
felt a great shaggy head, “it’s like the wolf dog that leaped
at Elzbietka this very day. Yes—it’s about the same size—and
here: the collar is exactly the same that I had my fingers
through. I know its feel by those little knobs that almost
tear the flesh. Father! Father!” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew turned about quickly. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dog,” answered the boy, “a friendly dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring him along with us,” said the father with a laugh,
“we can’t have too many friends just now.” And at that they
continued on their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now of all the creatures that God has put in the world a
dog is the most curious, and sometimes, one might think, the
most discerning. For when this same animal had broken loose
in the morning, his first impulse, which he had followed, had
been that of flight. His second impulse was to look for a
friend, since no dog can live without a friend. The Tartar
boy had already departed. The dog had seen too much of
him as it was. Also by virtue of a rare instinct which dogs,
and sometimes horses, possess, the wolf dog had realized fully
that the boy who had leaped at his collar was not an enemy.
Perhaps it was the boy’s touch, perhaps it was some quality in
the tone of his voice, but the animal knew that Joseph was
used to dogs and knew as well that he was just in his treatment
of them. Therefore he had searched all day throughout
the city streets, and when he came upon this little group of
people in the dark street his sense of smell told him that here
was a dog lover, and marvel of marvels, it was the same dog
lover that had sprung upon him earlier in the day!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned at length from St. Ann’s Street into a side lane
that is known to-day as Jagiellonska, and followed it for a
short distance until they reached the Street of the Pigeons.
Here they turned to the left and walked for a few steps until
suddenly just before them rose a babel of subdued voices.
Father Jan Kanty stood stock-still. The others also came to
a halt and remained motionless except for the dog, which
strained at Joseph’s hold upon his collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay,” said the scholar, “I will go forward to see what
may be in the air.” And holding his lantern at the
height of his head, he plunged into a crowd of black-robed
figures that had formed a circle in the very middle of the
street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Students,” he cried aloud, as he swung his lantern first to
this face and then to that, “students. And what devilment
make you here now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd broke before him at a touch. Either he was
much feared by them or greatly respected—that Pan Andrew
could see—perhaps both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A duel,” he exclaimed as he reached the center of the
crowd, where a space lighted by a lantern upon the ground
had previously been obscured by the bodies of the lookers-on,
“and what means it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two young men, both students, with their black university
robes lying beside them on the ground, stood facing each
other with unfastened underjackets. Slender Italian dueling
swords or foils, held firmly in the clasped fingers of their bared
right arms, had clashed the instant before Jan Kanty entered
the arena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A duel,” he repeated. “Do you not know that dueling
has been forbidden I know not how many times within these
streets bounding the university? Do you not know that it is
punishable by fine or imprisonment even, if the duelers are
students?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands groped fearlessly for the weapons. “This is no
play duel,” he cried, as he gathered them in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed it was not! The young men were fighting with
naked rapiers! In most of the students’ duels the points of
the weapons were capped with buttons to make them less dangerous,
or if the engagements were to be with broadswords,
the opponents wore breastplates and heavy gauntlets and helmets.
But here stood two young men without a single precaution
against injury, and it was quite evident that one of them
would have been badly wounded, had not the scholar brought
the fight to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means this?” he repeated. “Who may you be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holding the lantern close up to the face of the nearer, he
cried out suddenly in astonishment, “Johann Tring! As much
would I have thought of seeing you here as I would have of
seeing our own Lord Cardinal. You whom I thought more a
slave to a crucible than to a sword. And your name?” he
thundered at the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Conrad Mlynarki of Mazovia,” answered the student,
thrusting his weapon back into his girdle and letting his eyes
drop for shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Mazovian! Well, it rejoices me that you are ashamed,
and there was perhaps reason for your anger, since I hear that
Mazovians are insulted without much thought these days. Go
to your room! I will hear your story to-morrow. And you”—he
turned to the remnants of the original crowd, those
few who remained, maliciously hoping to see punishment meted
out to the offenders—“betake yourselves to your bursars with
all possible speed, for if I see one of you here when I return,
I will notify the authorities in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to you, Johann Tring,” he addressed the other student
when he stood alone with him in the middle of the street,
“are you not ashamed at such a public brawl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not,” said the student quickly and without flinching
at the look which Jan Kanty gave him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment Pan Andrew and the others came up to
them. In the light of the lantern Joseph glanced at the face
of the student, Johann Tring, and received almost a shock—a
feeling at least of violent repulsion. It was not that the face
was distorted, indeed it was not, the eyes were bright and
piercing, and the hair was black—the carriage of the body was
erect, and the whiteness of the skin where the collar was rolled
back stood in remarkable contrast to the hair and the blackness
that lay about him. But the nose was thin and mean, the
mouth was small and smug, and out of the eyes came a look
that signified an utterly selfish spirit behind them. For one
so young this expression was strange, and even more than
strange; it was unnatural, and this unnaturalness was more apparent,
even, to a boy of Joseph’s age than it might have been
to an older and maturer man who was used to much selfishness
and meanness in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what caused this quarrel?” Joseph heard the scholar
ask the question rather sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too long to tell at once——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but briefly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He insulted me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More things than one, but chiefly chided me about my
studies. Asked me if I had learned yet how to make gold
out of iron or brass or leather and said that he would collect
old shoes all over the city if I would transmute them into precious
metal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this upon no provocation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man hesitated, yet there was something compelling
about Jan Kanty that caused men to speak the truth to him.
“I did ask him if the frogs in the North country spoke Mazovian,”
he answered in a rather sour voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I thought it was something like this,” spoke
Jan Kanty quickly. “Why must one always aggravate these
Mazovians to their swords? I warn you here and now that,
swordsman though you may be, the Mazovians are much more
nimble with blades than with tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he said further,” went on Tring in self-justification,
and being unable to express himself clearly in Polish continued
in German, much to Joseph’s distress, for he could not understand
a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have more caution, Tring,” said the scholar at length.
“Since you are not enrolled as a regular student of the university
you must be even more careful in your conduct than if you
were.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since it is you who have first drawn your weapon,
it must be you who make peace. Go to-morrow at dawn and
kiss your opponent upon the cheek and sue him for pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This advice sat hard upon Tring’s temper, but he was so
much influenced by the scholar that he finally bowed his head
in consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And further than this I might say, Johann Tring, that
such occurrences bring you no credit. I know not much of
your studies these days, though I think sometimes that you
keep company more with necromancers and astrologers of little
merit than with such worthy men as Pan Kreutz and his equals.
These are dark days when men look with suspicion upon all
who engage in investigation whether it be honest or dishonorable,
godly or selfish. Are you still at Kreutz’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come with us since we are bound for his dwelling.
This Pan and his wife are taking the rooms below Kreutz’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man tried to peer into the darkness beyond the
lantern light to see who the new tenants might be, but none
of the Charnetskis were visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked ahead a few steps until they came to the door
where Joseph had been in the afternoon. Jan Kanty reached
up and pulled the wire which hung down from above the door,
and in a few minutes an old bent woman with a lantern scrutinized
their faces from the open doorway and admitted them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All will be well now,” said Joseph’s father. “We need
not trouble you further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been otherwise than trouble,” protested the scholar.
“You will be well and comfortable, I am sure, for all the arrangements
have been made. To-morrow I shall send you
the man who will tell you of your new duties. And now
good night to you, Pan Andrew—Kovalski”—he hesitated
a bit over the assumed name—“and may peace be with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with you.” They all repeated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kindly figure of the gentle, loving, saintly old man
passed out into the darkness again. The woman slammed the
door and bolted it heavily when the Charnetskis—now the
Kovalskis—Johann Tring, and the dog were inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last,” said Pan Andrew, “we are at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed through the passage with its pointed arches
and emerged into the court, the woman leading the way with
her lantern. Here Tring bade them good night and went to
his room on the right-hand side of the court. Joseph felt at
parting from him something of the same dislike that he had
experienced when the lantern light had fallen upon his face in
the street; the face was one that might easily come to haunt a
man in his dreams, and yet it was in daylight but an ordinary
face, like that of a thousand other students, who possessed
neither the gift of beauty nor the curse of ugliness—yet in
that yellow gleam of the lantern there had been upon the features
some indefinable threat of malignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman led them to the stairway on the left. As they
ascended these same stairs that Joseph had climbed earlier
in the day, the whole staircase seemed even more shaky and
rickety than it had appeared in the light of day. The woman
moved ahead of them freely, but Pan Andrew and his wife and
Joseph clung to the railing as if for protection in case the
boards should fall away beneath their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first landing the door stood open. Out from this
door came the welcome beam of a candle, lighted by the hands
of Elzbietka Kreutz. The father with this candle in his hand
at once inspected the little quarters. There were but two
rooms, one of them fortunately large and of good shape, so
that while one end of it must serve as a bedroom for Pan Andrew
and his wife, there was ample room at the other end for
the general living quarters of the family. The smaller room
at the back Joseph would sleep in. The woman who had
opened the door had been busy all the evening preparing the
place for occupancy, expending some of the money which Pan
Andrew had given her, for bare necessities, a rug, wooden eating
utensils, chairs, and beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had left his name as Andrew Kovalski with the woman,
the name which had been agreed upon with Jan Kanty, a name
in itself one of the most common, since it signified a smith—and
the alchemist and his niece having been advised of the
kinship with the Tenczynskis, willingly pledged silence concerning
the true name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, wife,” said Pan Andrew when they were alone and
the door fastened, “this is better than we dared hope.” Thereupon
he laid down upon the table in the large room the precious
round parcel which had not left his hands at any time
since they had set out from Jan Kanty’s cell. “Best of all we
are safe here; the door is heavy, the front of the building is of
stone, and from the rear no one could climb over the wall without
danger to himself. It is, indeed, the wall of a monastery
to which none but monks have access. Above us is the alchemist,
Kreutz, and below on the ground floor are the old woman
and her son, both of whom take care of the building and
watch the gate at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Across the way live a few students, one of them this Johann
Tring who accompanied us. Those seeking us would never
think of looking for us here; the change in name is also
a protection. Here we may stay in comfort until such time
as we may communicate with the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He intended to say more, but was interrupted by a curious
sound that came from outside as if a heavy body were dragging
itself along. The mother uttered a little cry of fear; Pan
Andrew reached for the handle of his short sword, but Joseph
broke into a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my dog rubbing against the door,” he said. “He is
tired and hungry, and no doubt wants a little water. There
is a well in the court below from which I will draw it, and he
can sleep then in the shelter of the wall. To-morrow I must
procure a chain or rope to fasten him with, for he is nearly
wild and might cause trouble if he ran about.” With this
Joseph searched in a basket for a bit of meat and a piece of
bread, and finding them, descended to the court below. It
was dark there but his mother held the lantern above him so
that he could see to draw water and settle the dog in a corner
of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they returned his father was preparing for bed.
The valuable package had been disposed of somewhere; with
curious eyes Joseph scanned every inch of the large room and
came to the conclusion that the only hiding place in the quarters
was that afforded by the bed, either in the shadowy place beneath
it, or somewhere in the bedding or folded clothes beneath
the headrests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ceased to wonder very long about it, however, for his
eyelids were heavy, despite his sleep of the afternoon. The
whole world drifted off into oblivion, it seemed, the minute
that he laid his head on the stuffed bag that served for a pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day all were astir early. The mother was at work
polishing the woodwork, and the father was driving nails to
strengthen the cheap chairs, or covering cracks in the wall,
and later inspecting the old staircase outside the building to see
if he might mend it. The daylight inspection brought with it
some satisfaction, for while it confirmed his belief that the
staircase was shaky, yet it revealed that the underpinnings
were firmer than might be supposed. The staircase might last
for some years if it did not have rough usage, and certainly
there was no immediate danger as Pan Andrew had feared the
night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph took an early opportunity, after he had eaten the
breakfast brought by the old woman who lived below, to run
forth into the Street of the Pigeons with the dog, whom he
named at once Wolf. In the daytime the street wore little of
the sinister aspect that it carried at night; the little oval
windows that had seemed then like wicked eyes peering
down, now were more like the eyes of merry gnomes or
pixies. The buildings which in the twilight, or even in the
night time when lights fell upon them, seemed grotesque or
terrible, in the light of day seemed only curiously twisted out
of shape and hung out and bent inward in every conceivable
fashion. All the lower windows bore heavy iron bars; doors
carried great metal hinges that spread like trees over the surface
of the hard wood, and chains dangled and rattled when
the house occupants went in or out. From some windows
hung clothes—women’s clothing, long hose worn by men, jackets,
and here and there, a student’s black gown. The novelty
of the street attracted the boy, and for a long time he wandered
through it curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the upper end, where it met a cross street that ran toward
the Rynek, the Street of the Pigeons curved quite sharply.
Joseph finally ran with the dog clear to this cross street,
which bore the name Bracka, and then, retracing his steps,
bore back to the house which had now become his home.
Mounting the steps rather breathlessly, he threw open the
door to the outer room and was about to shout a merry greeting
as was his usual custom, but checked himself at sight of a
stranger who stood talking with his father. The newcomer,
who had a pleasant face, was dressed in leathers somewhat
like those of the night watch when the outer chain armor is
removed. On the table in front of the men lay a long brass
trumpet, made cunningly and polished until it resembled
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the side of the trumpet lay two parchment scripts, one
of them evidently a copy of a long piece of writing, the other—as
Joseph could see—a set of musical notes worked carefully
in red and black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said the stranger, pointing first to the script containing
the writing, “is a copy of the oath that you have already
sworn. This other is the music of the Heynal, the
hymn which you must play from the church tower every hour
of the night. The trumpeter whom you relieve to-night will
give you the key to the tower room, and what information you
may need. It is a noble piece of work, this sounding of the
Heynal, and I am much pleased that Father Jan has been able
to find so good a Pole as you to carry out the night duties.
With this he kissed Pan Andrew upon the right cheek and departed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph stared in frank amazement. The Heynal! The
church tower. And his father!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you everything,” said the father as they sat
down to the noonday meal. “This oath which I have sworn is
the customary oath taken by the watchman-trumpeter of the
tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary. You may read it at
your leisure. The music is the hymn with the broken note of
which I have promised to tell you the story soon. It is played
each hour from the windows in the octagon room at the top
of the higher tower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are to be the trumpeter?” asked Joseph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, thanks to the good Jan Kanty,” the father answered.
“The trumpeter and the watchman as well, for it is from this
tower that fires throughout the city are sighted and the alarm
given with the big bell. For the present it must be for our
own safety that we are known as the Kovalski family, a name
which Father Jan has given us. As plain Andrew Kovalski I
shall be a mere city dweller of Krakow. I shall be trumpeter,
succeeding the man—God rest his soul!—who died but a week
ago, since which time there has been a substitute who can play
but badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the man said each hour of the night,” exclaimed the
boy. “Will you be there all night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Pan Andrew. “It is for my own safety
to be abroad in the city only after nightfall. None will recognize
me then—and as for you, my son, the good father has arranged
that you shall attend the Collegium Minus here, to
complete your studies which I and your tutors have already begun
with you. But there must be caution employed even by
you, for there are people who seek nothing better than to find
us and despoil us of our treasure. You may take your exercises
with the other boys very soon, however, and go abroad
with discretion, for in the clothes which I shall buy you there
will be no danger, I think, that you may be recognized. A
close mouth is necessary nevertheless. Tell no one of our adventures
and be content for the time with the plain name
Joseph Kovalski.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus at the direction of the good Jan Kanty, Pan Andrew
became Pan Kovalski—Joseph was to be sent to school—and
the watchtower of the Church of Our Lady Mary was to see
a new trumpeter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment that the father had ceased speaking, there
came running into the room from the staircase the girl Elzbietka
Kreutz, who made straight for Joseph’s mother and was
caught into her arms. “We shall be happy here,” the woman
exclaimed, “that I know, and here is one that needs a mother’s
love.” The girl turned to smile at Pan Andrew whose face
grew gentle at the sight of her eyes, and he picked up her slim,
dainty hand and kissed it—it was indeed a picture, that fragile
white hand lying in his huge brown palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle has told me,” she said, “that you are to play the
trumpet at the church. Often at night, when I lie awake lonely
and have strange fears, I listen for the music from the
steeple. And now when I know that it is Joseph’s father that
is playing I shall go to sleep again and fear nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as if I had two children,” said Pan Andrew, slipping
one arm about the child and the other about his son. “It truly
seems as if God has once more smiled upon us.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE TOWER OF THE TRUMPETER</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>ne</span> of the great sights of Central Europe, even in
those far-away days, which men came from all parts
of the world to see, was the Church of Our Lady
Mary in Krakow. Now though this church rose majestically
over the medieval city, its towers visible from afar, and its
red-brick walls as substantial and as solid as the very rock
base of the Wawel Hill itself, it was not from the outside such
an imposing sight as was its more aristocratic sister, the Wawel
Cathedral. It lacked flying buttresses and distinct Gothic
ornamentation such as huge gargoyles and flowers and saints
carved in stone, though its graceful form indicated a solid and
magnificent strength. It was not a church such as one might
gaze upon in sunny France where the mild breezes and sweet
sunshine permit delicate carvings and pinnacles upon the outside
walls, but it was built like a solid fortress to withstand
the mighty storms that sometimes sweep over Poland from
the wild steppes or from the Baltic Sea. It was the interior
of this church, however, that drew men to it, for within,
it was a very miracle of beauty, a crystal hidden in a shapely
stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to this church, then, that Pan Andrew and Joseph
wended their way after darkness fell on their first day in the
new dwelling. Pan Andrew carried the trumpet under his
right arm. Near the base of the higher tower a watchman
spied them as they approached, and unlocked a small, heavy
door that led to the tower stairs. They went up a narrow
staircase, winding about in the darkness, until it reached a platform
where the interior of the tower loomed suddenly above
them. Just at the right, as they began their ascent in the
main body of the tower, was a door that led to a little chapel
in which, as Joseph learned afterward, prisoners condemned
to death spent their last hours on earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man carrying a lantern shouted to them from above; they
waited then until he had descended—he was the day watchman
whom Pan Andrew relieved. He paused to kiss Pan Andrew
upon the cheek in welcome, and to speak a few words in
explanation of his duties above. Then he placed in his hand
the lantern and a key to the room which the trumpeter was to
occupy in the high tower. He wished them luck on their first
night and then descended by the side staircase to the ground
where the watchman let him out. Joseph and his father in
the meantime began to climb the steps of the scaffolding that
led up into the tower. This scaffolding was held in place by
cross beams, and at its edge ran the steps, so built that as a
man ascended he passed constantly from one of the four sides
of the tower to another side. The staircase was steep and
narrow, but very solid, so solid that the stairs did not creak as
they ascended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed and climbed, past five levels of windows,
glassed in with small white globes of solid crystal. Up and
up went father and son until they reached the level where
there was a room for the watchman. This octagonal room
was divided into two sections, one being the room where the
trumpeter might keep warm between watches, the other being
the open space around it from which the turret windows
looked out over the city. Here hung extra trumpets, here
were the ropes which connected with the great bell hanging in
the lower tower, and here were the red flags and the lanterns
which were hung out when a fire was perceived from the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it was the duty of the trumpeter to watch constantly for
fires. He was to watch also for troops approaching the city,
for tumults or disturbances of any kind, but he was especially
the guardian against fires. Conflagrations had done the city
much harm in the past; many of the older buildings were of
wood, although fronted with stone, and roofs were often of
thatch or soft wood that easily caught fire from sparks. When
a fire was discovered, the trumpeter or watchman, for he was
both, hung a red flag from the window which faced the direction
in which the blaze lay. At night he would hang out a
lantern with a red-glass front instead of the flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his duty also to sound the alarm bell if any danger
whatever came to threaten the lives of citizens. In the very
month previous to the coming of Pan Andrew and his family
to Krakow, the watchman had rung loud and long upon the
bell to alarm the watch and the city when the riot against the
Tenczynski family took place. In the coming year the bell
was to be tolled at the execution, in the town square just below
the tower, of the four men charged with causing the riot. The
tower was indeed the very center of Krakow activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew fitted his key to the lock of the door leading
into the inner room and threw back the bolt. Entering after
his father, Joseph found himself in a small, comfortable room,
containing a table, a bed, a small stove, and a lighted lantern
hanging on the wall. About the table were three chairs,
wedged rather tightly because of the lack of space, and upon
the table was a huge hourglass, one of the largest that Joseph
had even seen. The sand pouring through it in a fine stream
had filled the lower section almost to a level graded on the
glass with a Latin “X” to designate the tenth hour. The glass
was in reality a twelve-hour glass, and lines and Latin numerals
had been marked upon it just after the maker had blown
it into shape, when the material was still soft. This was the
trumpeter’s official clock. There was on the south side of the
nave roof, where the sun touched at all hours of the day, a
large sundial which was read each noon, and on the north
wall of the tower was a clock with one hand. This hand,
which indicated the hours, was in truth a hand—a piece of
metal shaped like a doubled fist—with fingers curled and the
index pointing out to the hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sand had reached the level of the glass at which
the “X” was cut, Pan Andrew hastened out to the open section
of the tower and released a coil of rope that hung on a
pillar in the center of the space. This rope ran down through
a hole in the flooring until it reached the level of the lower
tower, when it swung about over a piece of round wood that
served as a pulley and leaped from there to the lower tower
through an aperture that was originally designed as a narrow
window through which to shoot arrows in time of defense. In
the lower tower the rope was connected with one end of an
iron hammer that was suspended above the great bell. When
the rope was pulled the hammer descended, but it sprang
quickly back to its original position when the rope was loosed,
a spring of twisted metal and leather serving to draw it back.
Pan Andrew pulled once—the hammer descended—boom—the
stroke of the bell sounded over the whole city. He
pulled again and again until the full quota of ten strokes was
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next he went to the side of the tower nearest the entrance
to the little room, and swung back a small glass window.
Through this space he thrust the trumpet and began to play.
It was on the west side, the side toward the Cloth Hall, with
the university in the distance. Then he moved to another window
but one and began to play toward the south. Likewise
he played toward the east, and finally toward the north, according
to the instructions which he had received. Lights
were twinkling now all over the city below him, the air was
soft and smelled of the freshly cut grass which the peasants
gather into piles. In the direction of the university a group
of men were chanting a hymn. A clashing of iron hoofs on
the stones of Grodzka Street betokened the presence of some
armed men, perhaps the servitors of some nobles’ houses at
the castle, or perhaps members of the royal guard. Men of
the night watch could be heard banging at doors of shops
with the butts of their spears to be sure that no careless apprentice
or servant had left the door ajar. Down below in
the graveyard the white stones were just perceptible, dim and
gray in the dusk, and over the way the lamplighter was enkindling
the huge wicks of the lamps that hung under the Cloth
Hall roof. The stars were coming out, one after another,
in the sky where a touch of blue still lingered—across this
world rang the notes of the hymn which Pan Andrew had just
played exquisitely, the Heynal or Hymn to the Holy Mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is wondrous sweet,” said Joseph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so, my son,” replied the father. Thereupon he told
the boy of the morning, years before, when the square below
them had been full of hostile Tartars; of the lad who had kept
his oath, even with the last breath of life itself; and of the
honor paid him from that day to this by the tower trumpeters
who end the Heynal at the broken note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Joseph, listening, with eyes shining and heart throbbing,
realized more at that moment than ever before how dear
to him was his native land and all the customs that had been
bequeathed by brave men and women who had made it great
forever among all nations; it seemed as if tears were forcing
themselves to his eyes as he thought of the sacrifice of that
young life so many years before, but a thrill of pride drove
back the tears when he thought of the nobility of the deed, as
he stood silently gazing out of the little tower window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reëntered the inner room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have brought you here to-night,” Pan Andrew explained
when he had closed the door and hung the trumpet on the
wall, “in order to instruct you in the duties of the trumpeter
of this church. For there might come a time when I should be
ill, or perhaps even wounded—who knows, since I have so
many enemies? I have taken the oath that I will play this
trumpet each hour, and that it is no vain oath you have learned
from the story which I have just told you. The trumpet must
be played, happen what will. Therefore”—he drew out a
piece of parchment and sketched on it with a bit of charcoal
a series of lines—“you are to learn by heart the notes which I
sketch here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here are the notes of the Heynal,” he continued after he
had worked silently some minutes upon his composition, “the
tune goes like this.” He hummed the melody and indicated on
the parchment how each symbol represented a note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” he said, “it is necessary to learn. Work upon it
during the coming week, and at this time next week be able to
write it out. Do not let it interfere with your work at the
collegium but glance at it in spare time. Also, if you can,
sing to yourself beneath your breath the melody of the Heynal.
When you have learned the melody, I will teach you to
play it upon the trumpet. It is not a hard task, although perfection
comes only after much effort. I will teach you single
tongue and double tongue, and triple tongue which is the queen
of the trumpeter’s music, just as grammar is king of the scholastic
kingdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph slipped the parchment inside his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” directed the father, “go down the stairs quickly
and run with dispatch to our house. As you descend leave
the lantern against the wall on the lowest tower level; be sure
that you extinguish it. The mother is waiting and may be already
lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, I left her with Elzbietka.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless the child. But, just the same, go with all speed, for
city streets are dangerous at night. Keep close to the watchmen
where possible and if asked why you are out so late, reply
that your father is trumpeter in the tower and that you are
returning home with a message from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph descended; he left the extinguished lantern at the
place where the steps begin to mount the scaffolding, and felt
his way down the stone steps to the tower door. There he
rapped, until the watchman let him out. Once in the street
he was off like the wind until he found himself in the Street
of the Pigeons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much to his surprise the entrance door was opened, not by
the old woman who saw to the care of the building, but by her
son who up to this time had kept himself well out of sight.
As the light from the lantern fell upon his face, Joseph drew
back in alarm; when his father had mentioned the fact that the
old woman was living with her son, Joseph had imagined that
the son was a youth, or perhaps a boy—he did not expect to
see a man who had the face of one of middle age. Yet the
term “man” was less applicable to the son than was the word
“creature,” for he was lank and thin and bowed over uncannily;
long wisps of hair fell about his eyes; his fingers were
bony and clawlike; his cheeks were sunken, and his eyes peered
out of hollow caverns as if they feared the light. As he moved
ahead of Joseph, with the lantern in his hand, he clung to the
wall as does a cat, shunning open spaces and skulking as if always
needing a rear defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the foot of the stairs he stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph was about to pass him and begin the ascent when the
creature raised one of his hands and passed it over the boy’s
shoulder. Joseph heard the long nails scraping on his coat—in
a horrible second it seemed as if he could feel them on his
skin. The perspiration broke out on his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little—little coin,” whispered the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph handed him a piece of copper gladly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good boy—good boy,” the other mumbled, “bless thee,
bless thee. And when you have much that jingles remember
Stas. Stas I am, and here I sleep.” He pointed at the door
standing open on the lower floor, but Joseph’s eyes did not
follow him. His attention was taken suddenly from Stas by
a burst of flame that leaped like a live thing from the tiny window
of the loft of the alchemist on the fourth floor. It was
just a little flare—a small flame that issued through the opened
shutter which the alchemist usually kept closed—it died down
in a second or even less, but for that instant it lighted up the
whole court and the surrounding buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey,” said the man, pointing upward—“there they have
magic that takes a soul away from a body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See”—there was
another flash brighter than the first and longer continued—“there
be devils that come to earth with the fire of hell upon
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their servant is the alchemist, Kreutz, and they
have one among us here on earth that is more like them than
like us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know whom I mean?” He swung the lantern
close to Joseph’s face, the boy recoiling fearfully. “The student
Tring! He it is that would deal with the devil and give
him his soul. Have I not heard him at night as he lay awake
in his room on the farther side of the court, mumbling and calling
and singing? He it is who is the curse of this house.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Well, I must sleep. A good night to you.” And he went in
through the open door.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN THE ALCHEMIST’S LOFT</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>J</span>oseph</span> found himself too sleepy when he was inside his
tiny bedroom to give any further attention either to the
flashes of light from the loft above or to the mysterious
grumblings of Stas. And the beginning of his studies at the
Collegium Minus on the following day, drove, for the time
being, all matters of lesser importance from his mind. There
was an evening a week or more later, however, when the incident
recurred to him. He had accompanied his father as was
his custom to the tower, and, returning early, had paused for
a moment on the landing outside his door before entering the
house. The night was fine and he peered contentedly about
over the star-lit roofs, the red chimneys, and the black walls.
Down below him Wolf started uneasily in his sleep as if he
were dreaming of evil things. From the little window of the
room beside the door of his own dwelling there was thrown
upon the darkness a faint glimmer from a lamp which signified
that his mother was sitting up, perhaps with Elzbietka, who
had said earlier in the day that she would come down that
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell to musing in the sweet calm of the night as young
people will do, and in his musing wondered mightily what
might be the importance which his father had attached to the
treasure which he had brought to Krakow. It might be a gem
worth thousands and thousands of gold zloty—it might be
merely a fashioned piece of glass of value only to the tradesmen
who worked in glass. But then why had it made the impression
that it had upon Jan Kanty, and why was the bold
stranger so eager to gain possession of it? And why in such
a peaceful world must names be changed and goings and comings
veiled in a mantle of night? Why——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flash I Into the night suddenly leaped the same brilliance
that had startled him on that earlier evening when he had
been alone in the court with Stas. Only, immediately following
it now, here came a cry of someone in fright or pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door at the landing above him was thrown open and
a figure in white emerged. It began to descend the stairs hurriedly,
and, as it came near, Joseph saw that it was Elzbietka
in her night clothes, over which she had thrown a white cover-lid
from her bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke quickly in order that his presence might not alarm
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elzbietka,” he said, “it is I, Joseph. What has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle,” she cried, “Joseph, I know not what they are
doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were with my mother,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was, but I became sleepy, and she told me to go up and
sleep. I did sleep, for some time, too. But then this loud
talking and noise began. Joseph,” she came close up to him,
“Joseph, I am frightened. Something is going on upstairs
that is not good. The student Tring is with my uncle always
now. He came early in the evening, and they have been there
together ever since. Uncle never used to go up there at night
before—he stayed with me. Joseph, I fear that student
Tring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you feel,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that he has some power over people that is not of
this earth,” she continued. “You do not know how much my
uncle has changed since he first knew him. And I am all
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you hear to-night?” asked the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wakened by a loud tramping on the floor. Then my
uncle said, ‘No, that will kill.’ Then the student laughed a
terrible laugh. After that there was a long, long silence. I
was almost asleep again when I heard another voice—it was
like to no one that I had ever heard before. There was something
about it that made me think it was my uncle speaking,
but it was in such a tone that it made my blood run cold. And
now there are those flashes of light. Joseph, if you would
serve me, climb the stairway and look through the casement.
Do not let them see you, and do not stay long. Come down
as soon as you can and tell me that my uncle is alive and well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. But first you go in and stay with mother. You
can sleep here to-night if you wish, and to-morrow I will ask
my father what can be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knocked at the door, but without waiting for his mother
to come, ran up the second flight of stairs and reached out for
the first board of the rude staircase. When he had found it
he managed the ascent by clinging to the rail at the side, for
the steps here were much steeper than those below; indeed in
the dark it seemed to him a dizzy bit of a climb, but he managed
it nimbly and found when he reached the landing that he
could just peep in through one corner of the opened window
shutter. Had the shutter been closed, as it usually was, he
could have seen nothing, for the glass, consisting of little round
uneven blocks, was unglazed and set into a network of lead.
Through the opening he peered, clinging to the railing of the
stairs for support, and keeping one foot close to the top step,
in order to descend in haste at the first hint that the occupants
of the room were aware of the presence of a third person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he saw at first glance startled him, for the loft was
literally blazing with light coming from oils burning in four
copper braziers which hung from the ceiling. Above these
braziers, to protect the roof from the heat, were layers of
metal, one separated from the other so that an air current
played between them and cooled them. A fifth brazier, not
now alight, hung close to the window where Joseph was peering,
and it was from this brazier that the flame had sprung
that had lighted up the whole court—as a matter of fact, the
light had come from the rapid combustion of a handful of
powder which the alchemist had thrown on the brazier’s charcoal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loft itself was higher than the boy had realized—there
was but one large room in it, for on the farther side could be
seen the shutters of the building’s outer wall. In the middle
of the room at the back was a closet—for Pan Kreutz’s most
valuable substances, Joseph decided, since it was fastened with
chains as well as with a huge lock and key. The beams of
the roof, sloping but slightly, were well above the height of a
tall man, and were not of bare wood as is common in lofts and
attics, but were plastered over with some thick white substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the center of the room stood a tripod supporting an iron
basin and in it was burning some substance that gave a peculiar,
pungent odor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist in his black robe and the student Tring in his
leather jacket sat elbow to elbow before this basin. They
were watching something that was burning there in flames of
many colors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes away my strength,” Joseph heard the alchemist
tell Tring, “to experiment in the fashion which you have suggested.
It has interested me, and I know that it has its fascination,
but it is not, after all, in my sphere. I am an alchemist,
one who seeks the truth above all things in the actions
and reactions of material substances. I mix vinegar and sugar
and soda, and there is immediately a bubbling and a change.
Something new is created. I melt lead and silver and copper,
and they form together some metal that is new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are not these changes influenced also by the position of
the stars in heaven?” asked Tring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and no. The sea, I admit, seems to follow the pull
of the moon. Harvests depend upon seasons and seasons
sometimes seem to be servants of the movements of the heavenly
bodies. But as to other things I know not. Besides, I am
not an astrologer. I am an alchemist. The powers of the
sky may be found by those who search the skies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is not the conduct and life of man governed by the
stars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I leave to magicians and necromancers, as likewise I
leave to them that hideous magic which makes compounds of
cats’ paws, and owls’ eyes, and dead men’s fingers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” persisted the student, “you seek the Elixir of Life,
do you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered the alchemist, “although in regard to it I
admit that I have much curiosity. If it is true that all things
are subject to change, then one might change from old to young
as well as from young to old if one could but find the laws to
reverse the process of life. And as to this I do not doubt that
a restorer of youth can be found. Yet I am not interested as
are those who have lived vain lives and hope to do better it
life may be relived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Philosopher’s Stone, what think you of that?” Joseph
noticed a distinct change in the student’s voice as he said this;
his eyes shone with a greedy light, and his fingers seemed to
curl perceptibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” answered the alchemist, “that is indeed much
sought. To the superstitious and ignorant the Philosopher’s
Stone means only some substance which by magical power can
transform all things it touches into gold, like King Midas of
ancient days. But to us who study and work, it is apparent
that only a process and not a substance can bring this to pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How—how?” demanded the student, leaning forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is commonly known that each substance in the
world such as brass, or paper, or glass, has certain properties
in itself. Did not Archimedes, father of all our learning, establish
this truth by the proof that different substances thrown
separately into water each displace a different amount of
water? Gold is a substance, brass is a substance, both susceptible
to change in the elementals, fire, water, air, and earth.
Fire melts, water changes the color or disintegrates, air hardens,
and earth darkens. To make brass of gold, or gold of
brass is not impossible if one might know what would break
down the dissimilarity between them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you not keep trying until you find the secret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist drew a long breath. “There are things that
interest me more. Though I am an alchemist I am much concerned
with the spirit which is behind material things. I would
learn if life itself is a matter of substance, if there is not the
same difference between man and man that there is between
metal and metal. I would learn the secrets of the earth, the
messages of the sky, and I would know as well the secret of the
soul, and how one might seek to help and save the souls of men
whose bodies are from birth misshapen. I would learn, if I
might, the composition of the earth, the reasons for the spring
and summer and such phenomena—I would learn what makes
the stars to shine and the sea to be tempestuous. God has
given me a mind that searches ever for the light, and I feel that
I am doing His will when I seek the truths that lie about us
on every hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring came close and spoke very low, though his voice carried
to Joseph at the casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a fool, you, Pan Kreutz,” he said. “Here are
you, the most gifted scholar and alchemist of our time, fretting
away your hours in such pursuits with a much greater object
to be gained at your very elbow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I mean. You and I have begun to experiment
in things that men know but little of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, and I am of two minds about it. There is something
in what you persuade me into that I like not. But upon
such matters you are indeed the teacher and I the student.
This I do know, and that is that when I am in a trance such
as you sent me into a short time ago I can see things and hear
things and even know things that I am not familiar with in my
everyday mind. But such experiments, though they enthrall
the soul, are perhaps dangerous to men. They are tried in
Nuremberg, I believe, and in other lonely places in the Black
Forest. But here in Krakow we have ever been wary of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist was looking into the fire. Tring, sitting beside
him, cast at him at these words such a malicious look and
leer that Joseph shuddered. There flashed into Joseph’s mind
the word “demon”—a veritable demon from the darkness
Tring seemed, striving to exert some influence over his victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look passed. “Pan Kreutz,” began Tring again, “I
know from my teachers in the old town of Nuremberg that
man has in reality two brains. One of these brains is wise and
powerful and dominant, and yet one knows nothing of it except
when one is asleep in such a trance as I put you in but a short
while ago. The other is the brain of daily life; by it we know
when to eat, work, and rest. It is the lesser brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something of this you have proven to me,” said the alchemist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then use your higher brain,” commanded Tring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To what end?” asked Kreutz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the end that all men would reach. Gold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said the word with an intensity that sent a cold thrill
through Joseph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gold matters not so much to me,” answered the alchemist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does—it does—it does,” insisted Tring. “You do not
know what you could do with it. With this secret, you and I
could become the very kings of the earth. We could live in
the finest palace in the world—we could have diamonds and
rubies and emeralds—we could travel about the lands of Europe
like the mightiest of merchant princes—armies would be
at our disposal, and we could make every human being perform
our will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he forgot the alchemist as he reveled in this
dream made out of fancy and desire, but as a glance at
Kreutz’s face found no response there, he went on more cunningly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think what you could do as an alchemist I Is this attic
a fitting place for your experiments? Are these poor tools
sufficient for the concoctions that you would devise, and for the
laws which you would prove? You could become the greatest
alchemist in Poland—in the world! You could work in a
room that would contain this poor attic a dozen times. In it
would be every instrument that has ever been invented for the
study of alchemy. No precious substance that comes out of
the East, no priceless gem nor precious stone would be beyond
the means that you would possess. Does this not tempt
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had touched him this time. “It would tempt any poor
scholar,” Kreutz replied, in the voice of one who had seen a
sudden vision. Then more keenly, “But do you think that I
possess in myself, my greater self as you call it, this secret of
changing base metals into gold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure of it”—Tring was almost dancing about his chair
in eager enthusiasm—“if you will cease being a plodding
scholar and a fool, and set yourself night and day to conquer
this problem of the universe. Gold—gold—gold—that is what
every man wants. Success always means gold, and those who
work all their lives professing none but unselfish motives are
but deceiving others in order to make themselves reverenced
some of them perhaps are deceiving themselves. Why, with
gold—think what you could do for your niece, think what you
could do for the students of the university—you could make
this school and, ay, the whole kingdom of Poland the greatest
and most desired place in all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kreutz thought deeply for some minutes. It was quite evident
even to Joseph, young and inexperienced as he was, that
Tring had utterly poisoned the alchemist’s mind. Indeed now
Kreutz looking at life through the philosophy of Tring saw
that his own life was the life of a dusty plodder; it was the life
not only of a poor man, but of a foolish man who might be
better off if he wished, who now had the opportunity to do a
great deal for those whom he loved, if he would but set himself
to it. His thoughts had been on a plane too high for
practicality. He had idealized mankind and he had tried to
learn things which had seemed to him to be the very jewels of
knowledge in the crown of wisdom—yes, that was what he had
been, a dusty old plodder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with these thoughts he surrendered utterly to Tring.
“You are right, I truly believe,” he said with a sigh—“perhaps
then we can possess this secret which will make us kings of the
earth, as you say. With gold we can do these things, we can
accomplish what we wish in the world, we can help the
struggling, cure the sick, and do away with poverty entirely in
this kingdom. Yes, it is, after all, a noble task—shall we repeat
the experiment again to-night? Shall I enter into a
trance again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” Tring had gained his end, “it is getting late and I
would not repeat the experiment so shortly after the first trial,
for fear perhaps that it would not be so successful as before.
To-morrow evening we shall try it when we are both fresh
again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was curious that to-night when you were in the
deepest part of the trance, you called out that which every
astrologer, alchemist, and magician had sought for centuries
was within a few yards of the place where you sat. I had
begun to think that we were upon the eve of a great
discovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, it was then that something awoke me,” said the alchemist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the worse for us all,” said Tring sourly. “It was a
cry that brought you to your senses, upon the eve of so great
a revelation. It was the cry of your niece from the room
below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elzbietka,” exclaimed the alchemist with concern. “And
why did she cry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were not silent in your trance. You shouted that there
were some demons near by ready to kill you—you almost
screamed in your fear—and then you talked as if your tongue
were a pendulum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I did not answer the child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You sank back in your chair again, asleep, and this
time it was a natural sleep, for when I questioned you again,
you said nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist rubbed his eyes. “I am sleepy now, in faith.”
Then, wondering, “What could have been the revelation? I
know of no prize that could be near by. On the ground floor
is the old woman and her half-wit son whom I frighten with
fire—then on the second floor but the three poor refugees installed
recently. Across the court, only you and two poor
students. No, it can be nothing in the possession of any one
of these. Well, as you say, this for to-night is enough—” And
at these words Joseph scampered down the stairway.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>ummer</span> burned itself into fall. The Vistula which had
been growing ever lower and lower with the heat was now
but a narrow ribbon of water and the banks along it were
parched and dried and yellow. Leaves were changing from
green to brown and the birds were making ready to leave for
southern lands as soon as the first suggestion of cold should
appear. Across the meadows now the horses and wagons
were marching daily and the dry hay was filling barn and shelter
in all the country about. The fruits of the autumn were
already appearing in the market, the apples of the first bearing,
the golden squashes, and the late cabbage. And over the
city and country hung a sky of deep, exquisite blue, for in all
the world there is no sky so blue as is the Krakow sky, and no
sun is so golden as is the sun of early autumn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Month of the Heather had passed by and the
Month of Hemp Beating was at hand, Joseph had learned all
the notes of the Heynal and could play the little hymn upon
his father’s trumpet. Once even he had played it in the tower;
on that night his father had played it toward the west, south,
and east, and then had allowed the boy to play it at the north
window. The girl, Elzbietka, a little quicker of ear than
Joseph, had long since mastered the air and quickly memorized
Joseph’s notes, so that she could not only hum the music,
but reproduce it in writing upon a wall or piece of parchment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening when Elzbietka was visiting Joseph’s mother—and
she came more and more frequently now since the alchemist
had begun to carry on new experiments with Tring—Joseph
exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before long I shall play all four Heynals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let her chin rest upon one hand as she did often when
she thought and when she spoke seriously. “I shall listen,”
she said. “It comforts me more than ever now when I hear
the hymn played in the night time—since there is seldom any
one in our rooms when I awake. Joseph,” she spoke in a
very low tone, “do you know I think that my uncle is possessed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a great start. “Possessed—and by whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. But he isn’t himself. It isn’t that he is
out of his wits—no, not that at all. He is just as intelligent
and just as kind as he ever was, but he has become so interested
in something that he is doing in the loft that he thinks but
little of me or of his friends in the world. There is that student,
Johann Tring——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” he answered quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He and my uncle are together in the loft every night.
Sometimes they stay there until it is light. They say queer
things, and sometimes my uncle cries out as if he were in pain.
You heard them the night that I told you to go up the staircase.
It is always like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told father what I heard that night,” said Joseph,
“and he only said that it was none of our affair, that your
uncle is a man who has been very kind to us, and who knows
what he is about. Also he forbade me ever to spy upon
your uncle again. Father said that your uncle is a great
scholar and that he is now probably working upon something
that will win him fame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay—perhaps,” she meditated—“but I loved him better
as he was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that time on Elzbietka became more and more a
part of Pan Andrew’s family. In the afternoons she used
to bring her sewing downstairs into the front room and sit
there for hours working and chatting or humming little tunes
under her breath. When Joseph returned from his studies in
the afternoon the two were accustomed to walk out into the city
and see its changing wonders, its new caravans, its pageants,
its companies of knights and soldiers, its processions of guilds.
Often they walked out through the gates into the country
where there was rich black earth, and behind them or alongside
or ahead ran the great Tartar dog. The walks took them
to the old Jewish city of the Kazimierz, across the fortified
bridge on the west arm of the Vistula, to the old church on
the Skalka, where the holy Stanislas was murdered at his
altar, to the high mound above the city where it was said
that old King Krakus was buried; to these and to many other
places had they wandered while the sun was bright and the
air not too cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once they went to visit the towers of the Church of
Our Lady Mary in the late afternoon. The watchman let
them in at the little gate at the base of the tower and they
climbed up to the room where the day trumpeter was on duty.
He was the man that Pan Andrew relieved at night, and he
thought it a great honor to have a visit from such a little
lady as Elzbietka, and he told her many of the legends which
have come down from old days when the church tower was
being built.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph picked up his father’s trumpet from the table.
“When I first play all the four Heynals you must listen and
see if you hear a single note played wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/099.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0006' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I will listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I play a wrong note I will give you my cap. If I play
two, then I will give you Wolf.” He smiled then, as a boyish
thought came to him. “If I ever play the Heynal through
to the end, without stopping at the broken note, then you may
run to Jan Kanty and tell him to summon the watch, for then
something will have happened to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?” She was as ever serious, though he
was smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the story of this hymn, the Heynal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, when the Tartars burned the city, the trumpeter
stayed on duty and played the hours as he had sworn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A brave story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well”—Joseph liked to see the blue eyes widen—“one
night the Tartars will attack the city, or perhaps the Knights
of the Cross. I shall see them coming from afar, in the midst
of fire and smoke, and I shall hear war cries and their horses
hoofs. And I shall be all alone in the tower that night, for
neither my father nor any person will be here. And when I
realize that it is an enemy, I must have a signal, since I myself
may not leave the tower—a signal to some one in the
town who will give the alarm. So I will play the Heynal,
but I will not stop on the broken note. That note does not end
the measure, you know. I will play on, two or three notes
further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent,” she cried, and her cheeks were red with the
excitement of it. “If I hear you play the Heynal without
stopping at the broken note, I will run straight to Jan Kanty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, come look at the city,” he broke off conversation
on the subject. He was a little ashamed, for he had not
expected Elzbietka to take his remarks quite so seriously.
She had not taken the trumpet signal as the jest he intended,
but had rejoiced at it as do most young people when they have
a secret with some important person. And to her Joseph
was a person of very great importance, not only because of his
prowess with the trumpet and his progress in the collegium,
but because, indeed, he possessed somehow more than ordinary
seriousness for a boy of his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They peered through a little window. Off to the right ran
the Street of St. Florian with the gate and church beyond: new
towers were being constructed that very year in the walls
that ran about the city and two of them near the Florian
Gate were visible from the tower of the Church of Our Lady
Mary. To each city guild was assigned one of these towers,
to be kept in repair and to be manned in case of attack on
the city. The joiners’ and the tailors’ guilds had watchtowers
near this gate. Between these watchtowers and the
church were many palaces with large enclosures in the center,
open to the sun, where guards and soldiers were working or
waiting or disporting themselves, breaking each other’s heads
with quarterstaves or fencing, or shooting with arrows at
pigeons tied to the tops of high poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly below them the market was still busy although
it was late afternoon, for the peasants were ready to sell at
small profit what remained of their stock and go home;
under the arches of the Cloth Hall the crowds were still passing
from booth to booth examining the laces and embroidery
and fine silks that had come in from the east and south;
beyond the Cloth Hall rose the tower of the Town House,
or Ratusz, and in front of it two luckless wretches struggled
in the pillory while a crowd of urchins pelted them with mud
and decayed vegetables. To the left rose the peak of the
Church of the Franciscans—they passed to the south window
and there saw the twin towers of the old Church of
St. Andrew, and far beyond it the great rock citadel, the
Wawel, with its palace and cathedral glorious in the afternoon
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/103.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>There were blue shadows already lengthening across the
market when they descended from the tower and crossed
the market square. Against the palaces that lined the open
space there were more shadows, and moving like shadows
within these shadows, promenaded black-gowned students and
masters. They were moving definitely in one direction, and
when once caught up in the crowd, Joseph and Elzbietka followed,
unresisting, for they knew that some excitement was
afoot in the students’ quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black figures grew constantly more and more numerous,
until at length the two stopped and pushed right and left in
an endeavor to reach a position of vantage in front of the
dormitory in St. Ann’s Street. The dormitory was set back
from the street, and in front was an open court, grassed over,
in the center of which was a stone statue of Kazimir the Great,
the founder of the university. Here upon the pedestal
of this statue, leaning back upon the throne which bore Kazimir,
stood a man in the gown of a Master of Arts speaking
to the assembled students in the Latin language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard of him to-day,” Joseph told Elzbietka. “He is a
celebrated Italian scholar who comes here to read the writings
of the master poets and to recite some verses of his own.
He talks of poets who bear such names as Dante and Petrarch,
and he says that the day will come when a new learning will
rule the world. He says that men have been in darkness too
long, that the barbarism which fell upon the world after the
downfall of Rome will be done away with only when men
write in their native tongues and think for themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you really understand him when he speaks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a fashion. He speaks Latin as do all our masters
and priests and scholars. My father had teachers for me
when I was eight years old, and since then I have worked
much with the Latin tongue. At first it pleased me not at all,
for there were rules and tables and grammar, but when I
began to understand that Latin would admit me into the
proudest society of the world, then I began to like it better.
In the months that I have been here my teaching has all
been in Latin, and I hope, myself, to be able to speak it
fluently sometime. I can understand much, though not
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why does not this Italian poet speak, then, in the university?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might perhaps—but to a certain extent it would stir
up strife, since there are those among the masters who do not
like the New Learning, as it is called. Our old teachings are
all of the great Aristotle, and yet we have never read anything
of him in the Greek language—everything that we study is
in Latin. We have many treatises upon learning which the
masters have used for centuries, and most of them do not
desire to change their ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian scholar at that moment began to read his own
verses in the Latin tongue. He had scarcely finished, amid
much acclaim, when a Polish scholar mounted the pedestal
and began to read some of his verses written in the Polish
language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do they not all do that?” asked Elzbietka. “One
can understand them so much better. If I were a poet I
should not think of writing in an old language that no one
speaks except a few scholars. I would write of Poland and
its flowers; I would write of the trumpeter in the tower and
the blue sky that one sees behind the castle on Wawel Hill.
Truly, I like this New Learning as you call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph smiled but knew not what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” she continued, “why is not this learning as good
for women as it is for men? Why is it that all writings of
poets and scholars and men of learning should be read only
by men? I would read such writings, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was said with such gravity and such an air of wisdom
that at first Joseph was inclined to smile, but as he looked
into her face and saw the seriousness there, he desisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly,” he said finally, “I know not why you should not
read as do men, but I know of no woman who ever entered
the university.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned through a short lane from St. Ann’s Street
to the Street of the Pigeons they failed to notice a pair of men
conversing quietly behind the buttress of a house on the farther
side. Both were of short stature, and one was much bent
as he spoke he raised his long, lean fingers close to his mouth:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh-h.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is the boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other started and turned quickly, but appeared puzzled.
“When did you say he came?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bent-over man, who was no other than Stas, son or
the woman who lived in the court, gave the date to a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it must be he,” exclaimed the other. “On the day
that I saw him he was dressed like a country youth and his
clothes were dusty from travel. To-day he is arrayed in velvet
like any prince and has besides the cap of a junior collegian.
But his stature is the same. And you say that he lives
above you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Goes by the name of Kovalski.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m—it was Charnetski when I knew him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now,
you, look at me—do you see this piece of gold? That’s true
gold, red gold, an’ will buy many a dainty or many a drink.
That is to be yours, for your very own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stas almost shrieked for joy when the stranger put the
piece of money in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look you—no talking about this anywhere else. This
is my business, mine and yours, and I tell you that when we
are finished there will be more gold pieces for you just like
that. Now show me the place where they live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They followed along until Joseph and Elzbietka stood before
the entrance to the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the place,” said Stas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well and good. Now keep a close watch and let me know
anything that is new. I will be at the Inn of the Golden
Elephant every afternoon at the third hour, but do not tell
any one there that you are looking for me. Let your words
be only for my ears. And remember, the lantern in the man’s
face to-night. There will be much gold for you. You
understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man did. His very shoulders seemed to chuckle at
the thought of it. He let himself into the court and went
at once to his room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the other walked briskly to the inn and
sat down at a table. His thoughts were dancing in his head,
for by an extraordinary piece of luck he had succeeded in
locating the family of Pan Andrew. Luck indeed it was
because never, if he had come upon him face to face in the
street, would he have known Joseph at all. It was only because
Stas had named him as the son of the man who went
abroad only by night, that he could see any resemblance to
that boy who had sent his horse flying away through the mud
on that morning so many weeks before. For this man was
that same one who called himself Stefan Ostrovski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They disappeared that day after the riot,” he thought
to himself as he sat in the inn, “and were nowhere to be found.
The earth might have opened and swallowed them whole.
No other Charnetski in Krakow answered their description—I
had well given them up for lost and with them a castle
and coffers of gold in the Ukraine. For when Ivan, himself,
promises, then there is profit to be had. I return to the
Ukraine, but there is no word from them there. My men
are even now riding from city to city in the vain hunt. Meanwhile
I, answering some tiny voice of wisdom that speaks
from somewhere into my ear, come back here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck the table with his fist. “Men call me Bogdan
Grozny—Bogdan the Terrible,” he exclaimed, “but terror
often has brains. This venture has begun in luck and must
end well. And once I get what I seek from that white-faced
Pole he shall rue the day of my humiliation at the Krakow
Gate.” And with the thought of that adventure a look of
hatred came into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His attention was diverted for the moment by the sight
of a beggar with a dirty bandage across his face working
from table to table at the inn, begging for alms in a whining
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the beggar came near, the man dropped a coin in the
outstretched hand and whispered, “You come late to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, master, I thought I had a scent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beggar seemed to expect a blow, and assumed a defensive
attitude, when the man smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter, the work is done,” he whispered. “Mount
your horse to-night and ride like the wind for Tarnov. There
you will send out our brothers to bring in the men who are
hunting. It may take three weeks—but hurry before the first
fall of snow comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beggar took the orders, ambled out of the inn quietly
just as he had come in, and proceeded in like fashion until
he was well along the street which skirts the market on the
west. Then suddenly stepping behind a house buttress he tore
the bandage from his face and ran with all speed for the gate
on the Mogilev Road in order to get through unchallenged
before the night watch came on duty. He passed through,
sauntered down the road until he came to a small peasant
cottage with a stable in the rear; here he found the horse
which he had ridden to Krakow, and with a single word to
the owner of the house, who seemed to understand his movements
fully, galloped off to the distant bridge where ran the
Tarnov Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man at the inn continued to ruminate. “That stoop-shouldered
misbegotten thing that calls himself Stas came
to us like an angel from heaven. Often had I noticed him in
here talking and making free with all the beggars, and even
at first look of him, I thought to myself that here was such
a man as might serve a purpose for me sometime. So I
have the landlord bring him a friendly glass, and talking as
he drinks it, he drops a word about the new trumpeter who
never goes forth in the daytime!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the boy as sure as man can be sure, despite his
new trappings of velvet; and then the fact that there are three
of them, and the date of their arrival. To-night when the
trumpeter leaves by the door, Stas will hold the lantern to
his face, and I hiding near by will see—but there is scarce
need of that, it is as well as proved. My men will be here in
a week or two, and it will be but short work after that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was working pale in his excitement—it was all
white save the button mark which stood out on it like a clot
of blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would the honorable Pan Andrew have said that
day,” he chuckled, “had he known that Bogdan Grozny was
before him? For he, and every man in the Ukraine, knows
Peter of the Button Face. That was a good name I gave him—Ostrovski!
Ostrovski of the proud family at Chelm that
once called me slave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of the Button Face was indeed a name feared everywhere
in the Ukraine. It had been bestowed upon this man
whose real name was Bogdan, chiefly by the Poles, for among
the Cossacks he was known as Grozny or Terrible. A savage
outcast, born of a Tartar mother and Cossack father, he
had been involved in every dark plot on the border in the
last ten years. Houses he had burned by the score and men
and women he had put to death cruelly. Under his command
was a band of ruffians who would rise up suddenly in
the Ukraine, overnight almost, and set out upon any adventure
of fire and sword that he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not despised by great folk either—Polish or Muscovite—when
there was unlawful work to be done; nobles
often employed him for unscrupulous tasks that they dared
not perform themselves; the Great Khan of the Tartars
even had dispatched him on a mission among the Golden
Horde; his name was a power on both sides of the boundary,
for in Poland also he had confederates who served him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at the present time the great country of the Ukraine
which had come to Poland through the marriage of Jagiello of
Lithuania with Jadviga of Poland about one hundred years
previous—this huge land was full of plots and counterplots
in the struggle for mastery between Muscovy and Poland.
Ivan of Moscow had already begun to turn envious eyes upon
this territory which had been the heart of the old Byzantine
Russia with Kiev as its capital, and was making plans to wrest
it from Poland at the first opportunity. And in such fashion
many a dweller such as Pan Andrew Charnetski found himself
bereft of property and fields in a single night. For there
were many such as Bogdan the Terrible, or as the Poles knew
him, Peter of the Button Face, who were ready at a minute’s
notice to engage in some such fearful task with rewards of
plunder and captives for their work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, little realizing what savage forces had been let
loose against them, the family of Pan Andrew sat down to
a quiet supper.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BUTTON FACE PETER ATTACKS</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>C</span>old</span> weather came in late November—or Listopad,
the month of Falling Leaves, as Polish folk call it—and
found the poor people in the villages already fortified
in their log huts with the thatched roofs. Sand had been
heaped high about the walls of the houses, all crevices that
led to the outer world were stopped up with mud or tree
branch or stone, wood and charcoal were piled under table
and bench, and from the ceiling hung dried vegetables and
mushrooms and sausage. The geese and pigs still ran about
outside the house but would be taken in with the first frost to
share the “black” or large compartment of the hut with the
family. In the second or “white” compartment of the hut
the whole family slept when the weather was not too frigid,
but when the snow was up to the roof level, and the cold was
so great that one could hear trees cracking in the night, all
slept in the “black” room which had not even a chimney to
vent the smoke that poured out steadily from an open fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the city houses, wealthy men were beginning to build
high tile stoves of Italian pattern, but for the most part people
depended for heat and comfort upon the open fireplace.
When the first frost came boys ran hither and thither with
flaming coals for starting the first fires; up in the tower of the
Church of our Lady Mary the watchmen kept eyes constantly
wide open in order to detect as quickly as possible the patches
of flame which sometimes broke out from the roofs of over-heated
dwellings, and many a troublesome night was spent
by the water master and his men quenching such fires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light snow was falling on the last Wednesday of the
month, when Pan Andrew started for his nightly duties at
the church. The world had been going well with him, he
reflected, as he made his way through the dark and well-nigh
deserted streets: his son was making marked progress in the
collegium, his wife was happy and contented, he himself was
earning enough to support them both comfortably, and he
hoped that before long he would have a chance to present
his offering to the King. For it had not been possible thus
far to gain an audience; either the King had been away on
business in Torun with soldiers and diplomats, or he was in
Vilna, the home of the Jagiello dynasty which now ruled
Poland, or in Lvov where the Ruthenian subjects lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the short snatches of time when he had been in Krakow
neither Pan Andrew nor Jan Kanty had been able to reach
him, because so many had been waiting ahead of them—the
ambassadors from the Czechs who came to offer him the
crown of Bohemia, the delegation from Rome, the scholars
from Italy, the deputation from the Teutonic Knights asking
for a compact against the Hussites, and other men of title
and power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This delay was no great cause of concern to Pan Andrew,
however, since an audience was eventually assured. Late
in the summer Jan Kanty had sent a petition to the very throne
itself, and the King had advised the gentle scholar by message
that he would see him at the first opportunity. In the meanwhile
the treasure seemed hidden in as safe quarters as Pan
Andrew could ask for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was several hours after Pan Andrew had left his lodgings
on the Street of the Pigeons that there came a violent
ringing of the bell that summoned Stas. Stas unfastened the
door and thrust his lantern directly into the face of the man
who stood there, and for his pains was rewarded with a smart
blow upon the chin which tumbled him into the soft snow
which was now beginning to cover everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t do that again as you value your life,” the stranger
muttered as he picked up the fallen lantern and straightened
the limp Stas upon his feet. “You fool, don’t you know that
some one might have seen my face? If some watchman took
me, he would as well take you; it is for your safety that no
man knows anything of this meeting. Is everything ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” responded Stas a bit ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then tell me, who is in the building?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—there is the lodger on the top floor and his niece,
and there is the boy and his mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The students?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have gone to a discussion at the Hungarian pension.
Sometimes they do not return before daybreak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good I Then we can work without fear. A dozen men
will suffice, four to enter the rooms of Pan Andrew, four to
quiet the tenants if need be, and four to stand at the gate.
If the guard should come, we can silence him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you see the stairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they live——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up one flight.” They ascended the stairs, Stas in the
lead. It seemed to the stranger that the staircase swayed
a little beneath their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must take care here,” he muttered. “It seems as if
a weight would bring this down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a dog began to bark in the court below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” demanded the man, turning on Stas. “You
did not tell me of a dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is chained,” replied the other. “Will you give me the
gold now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here.” The man thrust him a few coins. He took them
greedily and felt them over in the darkness, for the stranger
was holding under his coat the lantern that he had picked
up from the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not all?” Stas’ voice rose to a whine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swine!” For a moment the man lost control of himself.
“Here is the rest, then,” and he swung his free hand to Stas’
throat, and sank his fingers in the flesh. Stas fought but
could not release himself from those fingers that dug like
iron points—at length the man freed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more of that,” he admonished. “The next time you
will find yourself in paradise, or some other world. Listen,
fool, once and for all—if all goes well here I will give you
double of that which you already have. But if you betray
me, or make one foolish blunder, then you will receive, not
gold, but a punishment that is worse than anything you
dream of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stas beat a retreat down the stairs, the stranger behind
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember,” was the final admonishment, “we will be here
just after the second hour has sounded. Let us in, and your
part in this is finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it so happened that Pan Kreutz, the alchemist, was
working alone in the loft above his room that night. He had
already finished one experiment, and was about to begin a
more difficult one, when his attention was caught by the sudden
barking of a dog in the court beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can that be?” he thought. “There is no moon
to cause barking, nor does the dog bark at any of the dwellers
in the court.” He quickly threw a covering over the lantern
that lighted the loft and opened the door so that he might
look down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His suspicions that all was not well in the court were confirmed
in the next second when he heard a whispered conversation
somewhere below, while the stairs creaked as if two
persons were ascending. Then all at once came an exclamation
of pain in a voice that he recognized as Stas’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More whispering, and the footsteps descended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next instant the alchemist, leaning forward to listen,
heard the stranger’s final instruction to Stas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is, then, some mischief afoot,” he decided. “Doorkeepers
do not let honest visitors into any house at two o’clock
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reëntered the attic room, and uncovered the lantern
after making fast the door. For some time he puzzled about
what he had heard. Who was the stranger, and what business
did he have with Stas, the watchman? And what ought
he to do about it? He was for a moment minded to notify
the night watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perhaps magnifying things,” he finally concluded
“More than likely two o’clock on the morrow was meant. Besides,
I myself could give any marauder here a very warm
reception—” he glanced about the loft. The thought seemed
to please him, for he chuckled for the space of a moment, and
then turned seriously to his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour or more his experiment, which was difficult
and exacting, held all his attention. But when it was finally
finished and the results carefully noted, the thought of Stas
and his mysterious visitor returned to him. In the stillness of
the late hour the affair seemed to show a graver face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jumped up suddenly and set the fires leaping in two
braziers. He melted a gum in one of them and heated some
liquid in the other. At length at the end of fifteen minutes
he covered the fires and took out the substances. With a
small brush he smeared the mixture of the two over his long
student gown that hung against the wall. Then he took the
mask which he used when making experiments with certain
poisonous gases, and covered this with the same drug he had
compounded in the braziers—the gum causing it to cling to the
surface of the mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but to sprinkle this with aqua phosphorata,” he
said to himself, “and the heavens will not be more brilliant
than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat back in his chair to wait, and with closed eyes tried
to reason it all out. “What can be the meaning of this?”
he thought. “The stranger with Stas stopped on the landing
of Pan Andrew’s lodging. What mystery can have attached
itself to this family? Why should the name be
changed? Who would seek revenge upon a man and a woman
and a boy? Elzbietka has found a mother, and I good friends.
They have no treasure with them, no money of any kind, for
even on that first day Pan Andrew was obliged to sell his
cart and horses for the means of living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was becoming drowsy, for he had worked much of late,
and had had but little sleep, and he was on the point of succumbing
to his weariness when he heard the watchman at the
Church of our Lady Mary strike twice upon the bell and
then begin to play the Heynal. The fourth Heynal was
scarcely finished when he heard a motion in the court below.
It was Stas creeping along the wall in order to open the door.
Throwing back his door noiselessly the alchemist lay flat on
the floor and leaned out over the threshold. The door below
creaked a little as it opened. Some one came in. The alchemist
listened. “One—two—three—more! By the lightning,
there must be a dozen of them, if footsteps tell no lies. I
did wrong not to notify the watch. If I shout now, he may
come, but there are enough to silence both him and me. No,
I have made my beer and I must drink it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next the stairs began to creak, and almost instantly the
hoarse barking of a dog cut through the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence that dog,” he heard some one whisper from the
steps. Footsteps were heard again in the court as if someone
had gone back to combat the animal. At this same moment
the door leading into the court was slammed shut, and
there was a rattle of the chain that fastened it on the inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A precious jewel, that Stas,” thought the alchemist. “He
shall pay for this to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cry of pain rang out suddenly from below. It was the
cry not of a dog, but of a man. “Ha,” thought Pan Kreutz,
“Wolf finished that one.” There was a sound of a man running
across the court. “I can’t get near him without injury,”
he whispered loudly to the leader of the party. “He sank
his teeth in my leg, and I am faint for pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three of you attack him at once,” directed the leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was scuffling again and suddenly the night was made
hideous with the mad howling and barking of Wolf and the
shrieking of men in pain; at this moment Joseph, with a light
in his hand, appeared at the door on the second story:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wolf—Wolf,” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not call again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew,” thought the alchemist, “they silenced the boy. A
gag, probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. The leader of the attacking party had seized
Joseph and thrown a cloth bag over his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the house,” he shouted to the men below. “Four of
you stand guard at the door. Four of you wait at the stairs
and let no one descend, and the rest come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the light of the lantern which he had taken from the
boy swung upon his face, the man watching above could see
that it was marked with a great round scar like an immense
button.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tartar or Cossack,” he exclaimed, “for the plague which
leaves such scars is an Eastern plague; these men have come
from a long distance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. This was indeed the band of that ruffian
whom the Poles called Peter of the Button Face and whose
bad fame men knew in all the Ukraine and the lands to the
east.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next second, almost, they were inside the house—Peter,
and three men following. There came to the alchemist’s
ears the scream of a woman, followed by a crash as if
she had been thrown upon the floor. Then came the sound
of the breaking of furniture, of the tearing up of matting, of
the destruction of everything within the house as if a quick,
violent search were being made. The door was open and the
alchemist could hear clearly all the sounds below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look in the bed,” the leader spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew and his wife slept in a large bed in the front
room. Swords were quickly at work ripping this to pieces.
They cut open the pillows, they tore apart the blankets, and
it was only after the bed was a complete ruin that the leader
found what he had been seeking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is,” he shouted; “that large package, done up
in cloth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his sword he ripped away the layers of cloth that
bound it—one by one they fell away upon the floor until the
object he sought stood uncovered in his right hand. But just
at that instant as he was about to dart for the door there came
a shrill voice, shrieking, “My gold—my gold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter turned like a flash. “Blood of a dog——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lantern was held up. Its light disclosed the face of
Stas maddened with the fear that he should not receive the
price of his treachery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gold! I’ll give you gold,” shouted Peter, infuriated.
“Some one take him and throw him down to the dog. Then
he can take what gold we choose to throw him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two men seized him, but he fought madly and dashed into
the room. There the third man headed him off and the two
others fell upon him from behind; his slim body wriggled loose,
however, and he fell across the table already overturned by
the intruders in their search for Pan Andrew’s treasure, and
clung there with ferociousness to the upturned legs. He
kicked, he bit, he struck out blindly—but they tore him loose
just as Peter set the prize on the floor to take the man in hand
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lantern rested on the floor behind him, and as the
struggling men swung toward him, Stas, shot with a brilliant
idea, worked a leg loose and kicked the lantern over. As it
fell the door swung open and the candle went out. Almost
instantly, however, the ruffians closed their grip upon him
and hustled him to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the rail he would have gone without further ceremony
had not there come the sudden screaming of a girl from the
floor above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The plague upon them all,” exclaimed Peter, dropping
Stas. “Here everything is as smooth as water in a lake, then
all of a sudden babies and fools raise the dead with their cries.
Come, we have enough—let us get out of this at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groped his way back to Pan Andrew’s bed, and was
feeling in the dark for the precious thing that was the object
of his raid, when there came a crash like that of thunder
from above, and through the open door appeared a terrible
red light that seemed to come from the sky and enveloped
everything for the moment in a garment of red.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE EVIL ONE TAKES A HAND</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>eter</span> rushed to the door and stood, staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Balls of red fire were shooting out into the air from
the opened casement of the room in the loft, flooding
the place with light as they burst with terrific explosions. In
the light Peter could see his men standing horror-struck, four
below him at the bottom of the stairs, and four on guard at
the door. Those who had been clinging to Stas on the landing
had recoiled in fright before the fiery balls, and the half-wit
had seized the opportunity to slink stealthily away through
their legs, and make for the lower steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Peter stood motionless. In bodily things he
was braver than the brave, but in the face of such magic as
this he was a coward; yet though he trembled, he realized
that he must play a man’s part if he wished to keep the leadership
of his band, and accordingly, spurring himself up to a
pitch of bravado, he rushed up the stairs from the second
floor to the third and stood there just as another bomb soared
out into the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back! Come back!” they were shouting from below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up! Come up!” he commanded. “What are you
frightened of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Evil One, himself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter shook his curved Cossack sword in the darkness.
“Come up—come up, I tell you, you cowardly dogs—come up
or I’ll separate your coward heads from your useless bodies.
Come up, I say—come up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so much was he feared that the three men on the
second floor landing crossed themselves in the manner of the
Greek Church and went creeping up after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have the treasure,” pleaded the nearest man in a
trembling voice, “let us escape from here. This is nothing
human. This is the work of the Evil One. Devils are abroad
and a man is not sure of his soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devils,” roared Peter, “bones and fiddlesticks! Come up
here, you, and be men. This is no devil. This is some joker
who values his head but lightly. If we do not silence him he
will alarm the whole city before we get back to the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up that,” he commanded a second later, shoving the first
man against the staircase to the loft. “Up that, and tell us
what you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man mounted, trembling violently, for he was sure
that the powers of darkness themselves were working against
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The door is open here,” he whispered, “and no lights
within.” A man below him on the stairway passed the word
along to Peter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then up, every mother’s son of you,” ordered the leader.
“There is a man there. Put a knife in his throat and descend
quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest pulled themselves up and entered the loft. After
a few minutes of impatient waiting Peter climbed the steps
himself and pushed himself across the dark threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you found?” he demanded impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” the answer came faintly from one corner of
the loft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there is any one here let him speak now,” Peter bellowed.
His voice drowned the quiet opening of the door of
a closet in the back of the room. “If we find any one it will
go hard——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky the loft was suddenly
illuminated with a glow of red fire as there leapt into
existence out of the blackness of the night the very incarnation
of the Evil One in his worst mood. Clad in fiery garments
which smelled of fire and brimstone and which seemed to blaze
and burn and give off a greenish smoke and flame, he moved
slowly forward, waving in his right hand a scepter of flaming
red which was crackling with heat as a green bough crackles
when it burns, while from its end little balls of fire were
dripping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so sudden, so unexpected, this apparition in a pitch-black
world of night, of a red, fiery, glowing devil, that Peter,
stout-hearted as he was, let out a sudden shriek, and trembled
like a leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if he trembled, the others went mad with fear. “Out!
Out!” they shrieked, crowding to the stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon their heels came the fantastic demon waving his scepter
right and left and favoring first one and then another with
smart blows, as they fought to be first at the stairway. Two
reached it at one time and went scrambling down to be joined
by the third a second later, who came tumbling down upon
them just as they gained the third-floor landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter, however, stood his ground for a moment. Turning
about at the head of the stairs he shouted, “Be you man or
demon I will see what you have in you,” and rushed with his
drawn sword upon the weird figure. That one simply stood
aside as he rushed, and waved his hand in the direction of the
man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahew—ahew!” the brigand screamed with pain, for something
choking and powdery was filling his eyes and throat.
“Help—cowards—I am in the hands of a thousand devils.
Help, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sound outside save the noise of the men
scrambling down the next stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter stumbled blindly to the steps, and fairly slid down
them, fearful lest the phantom should follow and give him
another dose. But the phantom, though following, did not
repeat his attack; he came slowly down the stairs after the
retreating party, hurling little bombs of colored fire into the
air, which as they exploded flooded the court with lights of
rainbow hues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below, the din was deafening. The dog had worked his
head loose from the bag which had been thrown over it, and
was barking at the top of his lungs. Men were shouting and
crying out in terror, forgetful of caution and the necessity for
silence. Joseph who had been gagged and bound in the rear
room of the family’s dwelling had gotten his feet loose from
the ropes and was kicking with all his force against the wooden
partition wall, Elzbietka was crying out for aid, and heads
were beginning to emerge from open casements in all the
adjoining buildings. Some one in the street outside was calling
loudly for the watch, and Stas, having rescued himself
from one predicament, was for no reason at all pulling at
the rope of the bell that hung over the door, its clamor adding
to the general uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the landing at the second floor the three retreating
ruffians collided with the four men standing there and almost
toppled them into the court. They had barely regained their
balance when the lower supports of the stairs, which had been
groaning already from the unaccustomed weight and traffic,
suddenly collapsed and catapulted the whole company, amidst
indescribable turmoil, into the court below. Peter, coming
behind the three, managed to save himself by leaping nimbly
to the threshold of Pan Andrew’s dwelling, but the flaming
figure behind him remained momentarily on the stairs above
the second floor where the supports and staircase held firm.
Not for long did he remain there, however, for as Peter
turned his back to disappear into the house the pursuer leaped
from the lower step of the remaining stairway and landed
squarely upon Peter, hurling him with a crash to the floor
well inside the front room of Pan Andrew’s dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below in the court there was a veritable pandemonium—the
crashing apart of beam and beam where the staircase struck
the ground, the shrieking of the frightened, the moaning of
the injured—for two men had been pinned beneath the fallen
staircase—the terror and distraction of the ruffians on guard
below whose one idea now was to escape through the outer
door before the arrival of the watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While all this was transpiring in the court the alchemist,
who with his chemicals and powders had caused all the trouble,
shook his heavy scepter, a club smeared with glowing resin, in
the face of Peter who lay prostrate beneath him and
demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now—what do you seek here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Peter had gotten some of his courage back, and besides
the voice sounded more like that of a man than a devil. “I
will not tell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be turned over to the watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I care not. They can learn nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First let us have another look at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He carefully drew a fire ball from a fold of his gown,
keeping his weight upon the man under him and holding one
hand at his throat. The ball he ignited by rubbing it against
the floor and when it was burning he tossed it upon the stone
hearth. There was a flash of light and the room was suddenly
as bright as even day could make it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, after all, he did not look at Peter! For there was
something else in the room that claimed his attention at once.
It was the large round object that Peter had sought in Pan
Andrew’s bed—there it lay upon the floor a short arm’s length
away, gleaming like a thousand prisms of finest glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho,” he exclaimed, “oho! So that’s it. Well, Pan
Robber, it seems that your expedition was no ordinary
one. No common house looting, this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lie still there,
or I’ll sink these fingers into your windpipe,” for Peter had
tried to wriggle to one side while the alchemist’s attention
was taken with the new object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who sent you here?” demanded the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must talk. Do you hear that—below?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the night watch shouting, “Stand, in the name of the
King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter whose courage was now revived, since he realized
that it was a man and not a devil that he was dealing with,
decided to try a little strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you all, if you will hide me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give no promises. But tell me what you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then see that.” He twisted one hand away from his captor
as if to point toward the shining object on the floor which
was now gleaming like a miniature sun in the last rays of the
nearly burnt-out fire ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see it.” The alchemist glanced at it; the instant’s relaxation
proved fatal, however, for with the moment the under
man’s right hand came clear and tore the alchemist’s grip from
his throat. In the struggle that followed, the alchemist was
no match for the lithe and wiry Cossack. They rolled back
and forth across the floor, tight in each other’s arms, they
broke table legs, they brought down crockery from the shelves,
they crashed into walls—and through all this the Cossack little
by little overcame the advantage which the other had held in
the beginning. First he twisted his legs in such fashion that
he caught Pan Kreutz’s body as if in a vise, a trick that he
had learned in the old days in the Ukraine, then he snapped
his hands free from the other’s grip and wound his arms in
under his shoulders. Tighter and tighter he drew arms and
legs until the alchemist’s bones began to send out cracking
noises; then with a quick movement he had reversed their positions
and it was he who was on top and the alchemist underneath.
“Smash!” He had bumped the man’s head against
the floor with all his force, a blow sufficient to stun a giant,
and in an instant had tossed him against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There the alchemist lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a panther moving to attack, Peter seized the object
which he had come to procure, and leaped for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not reach it unscathed. Pan Kreutz had also a last
stratagem. It was fortunate for him that when the Cossack
bumped his head against the floor, it was his mask that had
borne the brunt of the blow—otherwise it is doubtful if he
could ever have risen. But when the Cossack tossed him
aside he lay there feigning unconsciousness, and as the other
turned, he reached with a swiftness as quick as Peter’s into
a pocket of his gown, where he had concealed a small package
of explosive powder which might be ignited only by concussion.
A wonder it was indeed that the powder had not
exploded while they were wrestling on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Pan Kreutz poised in his right hand as Peter made
for the door. In another second the man would be gone—the
alchemist caught his balance and hurled the package with
all his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fair shot! It caught the Cossack with full force
square on the back of the head and burst with a loud report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those below, now already turning their attention to the
noise and the confusion on the second floor, heard the sharp
explosion and saw the court flooded with light. In the midst
of the glare there came a shriek that seemed to stir every
corner of the courtyard, and almost immediately a man with
hair flaming and garments streaked with fire sprang from the
threshold of Pan Andrew’s lodging to the edge of the stairway
that had not collapsed, and darted to the floor above. He
stopped there only for one fleeting glance below. The court,
blazing with torches and alive with tumult, was full of figures—students,
watchmen, soldiers—so that escape that way was
impossible. He leaped to the loft stairway and mounted it.
Clutching at the roof which was not far above his head, he
swung the low door back until it lay alongside the house and
then climbed over it to the roofing. Along this he rushed like
a meteor, his blazing hair streaming behind him in a trail of
sparks—he leaped to an adjoining roof, and then to another,
until he came to a place where the roofs sloped down to a wall,
and there he was seen last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hue and cry was set up, but the man had escaped. Some
said that he ran along the top of the wall and leaped into a
monastery garden beyond—others that he only pretended to
descend and had crept back among the housetops. At any rate
he was not discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When temporary stairs were finally put in place the watchmen
released Joseph and his mother from the small room in
their own quarters where they had lain bound, and brought
Elzbietka down to them. Pan Kreutz, who had retired to his
loft where he shed his torn gown and his mask, was bleeding
and weak from his struggle and lost no time in getting into
his bed. It was thought by all that the robbers had carried
away nothing, but when Pan Andrew returned in the morning
the house was searched thoroughly only to find that the
treasure was missing. Spectators swore that Peter could not
have carried anything with him when he made his perilous
escape over the roofs, and a few said that they had noticed
that his hands were empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, hunt high or low as they did, the treasure was
gone, and Pan Andrew, in spite of the views of the spectators,
was fully convinced that the robber had stolen it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those of Peter’s band who had been injured in the fall of
the stairs or had been unable to escape from the court were
taken to jail and sentenced to various punishments. Several
were put away into dungeons where they could do no more
harm, two were banished “for a period of ninety-nine years,”
and the rest were delivered to justice in other towns where they
had committed previous crimes. But the most vigorous questioning
could get no information from them, and it was concluded
that they knew little of the designs of the leader upon
Pan Andrew. As for Stas, his mother would have naught of
him after this act of treachery. She lost little time in turning
him out of her house and never would she receive him back
again. It was heard some time later that he had become a
waiter in the Inn of the Golden Elephant, but after the robbery
of a guest there one night, he disappeared and was never heard
of in Krakow again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Kreutz, although somewhat unnerved by his share in
the encounter, met Pan Andrew in his lodging the next morning
and described as fully as he could the man who had been
leader in the events of the preceding night. He had scarcely
finished when Pan Andrew sprang to his feet and struck the
back of his chair with his fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as I thought,” he exclaimed fiercely, “the man who
has assailed me twice before. And now I know for a certainty
that it is that half Mongol, half Cossack that calls himself
Bogdan and is known as the Terrible throughout the Cossack
lands. I have heard of his evil deeds many times, as has
every dweller in the Ukraine. And it would be like him indeed
to lead this villainy against me. He is a very devil, a
man without pity, though I will say a man of the boldest breed
that God ever benefited with the gift of breath. We, the
Poles of the Ukraine, knew him as Peter of the Button Face,
because of the scar which you have seen upon his right cheek,
and by that scar I would doubtless have recognized him on
the morning when he attacked me outside the Krakow Gate,
had I not believed that he carried on his lawless deeds always
nearer the border.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus saying he went sorrowfully to his work of repairing
the damage done by the Cossack band.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>own</span> in the Ukraine that winter when men went about
from habitation to habitation on the little horses that
had noses so pointed that they could poke them
through the snow and eat the dry grass of the steppe beneath,
it was known that a great change had come over a certain
Bogdan, called the Terrible along the Dnieper and Volga, and
Peter of the Button Face among the Polish colonists. It was
not that he had lost so much hair that certain ones called him
behind his back Bogdan of the Singed Locks, that made him
sad and contemplative instead of boisterous and ready as he
had once been—it was the effect of some failure that brought
on despondency and kept him a recluse for several months.
When he did return at length to men’s sight and began to appear
in the taverns, his hair had grown to its accustomed
length and a huge scar that fire had made was nearly healed
over. It was hinted, too, that he had made a journey clear
up to the land of the Muscovites and had had conference with
Ivan, called the Great, but this he did not speak about, and
men dared not question him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spring came with the month of March in the year 1462,
with peace over all the Dnieper lands, save where here and
there tribes were on the march, or the Tartars were threatening
raids. With spring set out Bogdan the Terrible, and with
him traveled as fine a crowd of cutthroats and cattle stealers
as ever the Ukraine knew. They rode to Rovno, the town
of the Level Plain, and then struck out for Chelm on the border
just beyond the River Bug. They established headquarters
in the Lublin Woods for a time, for the purpose of pillaging,
and then hearing that soldiers had been sent after them,
they vanished into the swamp lands to the north and were
not heard of again in those parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems that Peter had opposed this pillaging from the
first, because he had other work in hand, but they were tribesmen
and wild, fond of robbery and theft and eager for gain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Tarnov, having them well in hand again, he organized
them into a caravan of Armenian rug merchants and marched
them—carts, horses and merchants—to Krakow, the great
market of the eastern part of Europe. In Krakow they
camped with their wares in the square on the east side of the
Cloth Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the saddest man in Krakow at this time was Pan Andrew
Charnetski—sad because he had lost, through no fault
of his own, a treasure which he had intended to present to the
King of Poland, and evidently a treasure of great worth since
certain men seemed to envy him its possession. Jan Kanty
sought to comfort him, and his wife and son and Elzbietka did
much to divert his thoughts from the seriousness of the loss,
but on the long nights when he was alone in the tower, moods
of depression would often engulf him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph, knowing this, took to visiting him in the night vigils
when it was possible, before holy days and vacations when
there was no collegium on the following morning; often he
would come with his father at the tenth hour of the night and
remain until morning. Sometimes he would take the duties of
the watchman while his father slept and sound the Heynals
at each hour and inspect the city regularly from each of the
tower windows in order to sound the alarm whenever a red
tongue of flame leaped into the sky. Joseph had progressed
each day in playing the trumpet and could now sound the Heynal
as well as his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/135.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0008' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>He was in the tower with Pan Andrew on this same night
that Peter and his caravan of merchants were encamped in
their carts in the market place below the church. The moon
was at its full and the shadows of the church towers fell far
across the street and market. Down in front of the church
doors a watchman with lantern and halberd paced to and fro
calling out, as was his custom, the hours as they were sounded
from the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had already called out the first hour when Peter of the
Button Face, watching from a cart across the square, decided
to make his first move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Michael,” he called in a loud whisper, “Michael.” And
at that a man in a suit of leather with hat to match and thick
sandals slid out of the next cart. He had already divested
himself of the round turban and blankets that he wore as an
Armenian merchant, and his body seemed to move in a constant
succession of quiverings and glidings—in fact he had always
been known in the Ukraine as the Snake—and he stood
for a moment by his chief’s wagon to receive a whispered command
in one ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, true to his name, he wriggled beneath a dozen carts
and past the flank of an outhouse near the church to take
refuge behind a tree that grew at this corner of the Rynek.
Doubled up here he waited until the watchman should pass
in front of the church. He had not long to wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out from the shadows at the base of the church emerged
suddenly a man carrying a lantern that threw a star-shaped
light about it. This man tested the door to the stairs leading
to the trumpeter’s tower, found it securely locked, yawned,
and struck the paving stones several times in front of the door
with his long halberd as if he were weary of doing nothing.
The Snake’s eyes sized up this man as his opponent. He was
a man perhaps past middle age, clad in a garment of leather
over which was a very light chain armor, poorly woven; this
fell like a skirt with pointed edges just below the knees. Above
the waist the links of armor were a bit heavier extending over
the shoulders and back into long sleeves clear to the wrist, and
up past the neck to a kind of head covering like a cowl, over
which he wore a pointed helmet of rough metal. Outside the
armor he wore a very short leather vest caught with a belt
from which hung a short sword, and across the shoulders just
below the neck another belt with a buckle at the left where the
halberd could be secured and balanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed from the front of the church to the south side,
looked about carefully to see if there were any signs of life
in the street or square, and, finding none, turned away from
the church and entered the churchyard at the south where the
moonlight fell brightly upon the old gravestones. Squatting
down behind one of these, and crossing himself as if in excuse
to the people buried there for disturbing their slumbers, he
laid his halberd on the ground at his right side and the lantern
at the left. Then reaching into a wallet which he wore at
his girdle, he took out a crust of bread and a huge portion of
meat. These he began to eat with no suspicion of any interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this conduct he was justified, for he had been doing this
same thing over and over again for many years; there had
been no serious duties about the church save perhaps on a holy
day when youth on mischief bound would play some trick upon
the watchman, and them he could easily dispatch about their
business. Thieves seldom troubled churches in this period
and the cemetery itself was guard enough against marauders
in a period full of superstition. Up above him the trumpeter
kept a much stricter vigil, and all about the town, the watch
tried house doors and questioned late passers-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-ho-hum!” he yawned. Such a quiet thing was life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But—flattened against the church wall behind him was one
whose intention might have disturbed those weary thoughts
had the watchman been able to discern it. The Snake had
sized up this situation with rapidity and had taken advantage
of the moment that the watchman turned his back upon the
square to dart into the projecting shadow of a buttress. Edging
along the wall, he moved cautiously until he was but a few
yards from the tombstone by which the watchman sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plof! The Snake had pounced like a hawk on a mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not even a scuffle, so prepared was the intruder
and so taken by surprise was the victim. Down went the
watchman on his back by the side of the grave and in a second
the deft Michael had bound his scarf tightly about the man’s
mouth, so that he could not utter a sound. It was the work
of a moment as well, to secure the hands and feet with short
bits of rope that he carried in his jacket—he was at first minded
to cut the man’s throat with his own sword, but he feared
lest he might make one last dying cry and upset all their
plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the victim’s leather vest he found a huge brass key.
This he cut loose from the short chain which held it and thrust
it into his own belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then making sure that the bonds were secure, he leaped
back into the shadow of the church and stole back to the
wagon of his chief as deftly as he had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have bound and gagged the watchman behind yon gravestone,”
he reported, “and here is the key to the tower
door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whispered command traveled along the line of carts.
Then there was a general doffing of blankets and turbans and
the band of Peter, in leather jackets and hats, high hose and
tall soft boots, stood ready behind their carts to follow the
leader into his excellently planned enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a short distance from the carts to the tower, and
Peter led the way, keeping close to the ground in the shadow
cast by the tower. They stood at length, about twenty of
them, within the shelter of the angle which the tower made
with the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep close behind me,” said the leader, “when we mount
the steps, and watch lest there be loose boards in the stairs
beneath your feet. The boy is here this night in the tower
with his father. Mount carefully, but rush and secure both
father and son when I give you word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he fitted the key which Michael had stolen from the
watchman, to the lock, and swung the small iron door on its
hinges. He had to stoop as he went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet,” he whispered, “follow closely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a very few minutes they were all inside. The last man
following directions closed the iron door so that if a curious
passer-by should inspect it, he would find it shut as it was usually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The task is easy,” whispered Peter when they had climbed
the narrow steps that led to the stairs built in the tower scaffolding,
“we have now but to bag our rabbit. But you must
see to it that he is not a noisy rabbit. If he once gets his hand
on a bell rope he will awaken the whole town with his ringing.
He must be secured quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went up and up, mounting quietly the stairs that wound
about the heavy scaffolding, and treading ever carefully so that
not a single board should squeak. At last the leader stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The light is just ahead,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the opened door of the tower room came suddenly
the voice of Joseph, “You can sleep for the rest of the
night, father,” he said. “I will sound the Heynal at every
hour; the hourglass is plain to read and I shall make no error.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was lucky to hit upon a night when they were together,”
thought Peter. “We can bind the old one and make the young
one show us the way to the prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph had just spread a manuscript before him on the table
in the tower room and had moved a taper close to it to begin
reading, when he heard a sudden noise just outside the door.
Turning about sharply, he was just in time to see the door
thrown violently open, and then three men rushed toward him
before he could even assume a defensive attitude; he was absolutely
powerless. One man held his arms as closely gripped
as in a vise, while the two others leaped upon Pan Andrew as
he rose, dazed with astonishment, from the little bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fourth man stood in the doorway. His hands were at his
hips and he laughed merrily. “Ho—ho—my merry singing
birds,” he said. “We meet again high up above the noisy
world where none can come to disturb us.” Then his brows
darkened and he asked, “Do you know why I am here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph shuddered. This man was the same that had met
his father on the first day that he had seen Krakow—this was
the man that had incited the crowd in the Rynek to stone his
people—this was the voice that he had heard while he lay
bound hand and foot in the small room of his lodgings. But
at the same time he wondered what had brought the man back
to the city. He had already obtained the prize, Joseph
thought, after the risk and danger of the first trial. Was it,
perhaps, that he wished to avenge himself upon his father for
the incident of the cart?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph made a motion as if to cross himself at thought of
this, for here they were high up in the air above the city, and
nothing would be easier than to hurl a man from the summit
into the graveyard below and none would know of it until
morning came and they found the lifeless victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew, however, looked at the intruder steadily.
“No,” he said, very deliberately, “I do not know why you are
here. But I do know you now, Peter of the Button Face,
sometimes called Bogdan—it is strange that I did not recognize
you that morning when you threatened me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter took notice in no way of Pan Andrew’s latter statement.
He heard only the negative answer. Apparently he
had not expected it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not? You lie! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you think that I do not
know everything?” He pushed his way in and held the candle
close to the prisoner’s face. “I say to you that I have come
all this way to get what I want; I have the means for doing
it, too, and I have men in this company that would rather see
a dog like you dead than alive. Now come—if you value your
skin. Where have you hidden the Great Tarnov Crystal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph leaped with a thrill. This, then, was the prize that
they had brought from the Ukraine—a crystal, the “Great
Tarnov Crystal,” whose loss the father had not ceased to
mourn. But, after all, was a crystal something that men
valued so highly? If it were a diamond or a precious stone
there might be some reason for so much covetousness, but a
mere crystal—why, he himself knew caves in the Ukraine
where one might knock rock crystals from the walls. But
perhaps this had a certain significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know as well as I,” returned Pan Andrew, “that it
disappeared on that same night that you attacked my lodgings.
If you have it not, I know not where it is to be found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It disappeared!” Peter was at first shocked, then incredulous.
“You lie!” he shrieked, “you lie! You have it
still. I will find a way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come here!” he called to
Michael the Snake, “take this boy to the house where he lives
and keep always your knife at his throat. I will stay with
the old one here and if you do not return in a quarter of an
hour we will put this Pole out of all trouble in this world.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No,” he continued, as if changing his mind, “I will
go with the brat myself. While we look the house over you
keep your sword close to the old fox’s throat. If the boy
leads me the wrong way I’ll slit his throat, likewise if he tries
to betray me. But if we do not return with the crystal in a
reasonable time do as I have told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Pan Andrew would gladly give up the crystal to save
not only his own life but that of the boy, the Cossack had believed
firmly. Therefore his denial of the possession of the
crystal was unlooked for and baffling. However, he dismissed
the matter from his mind promptly. Undoubtedly Pan Andrew
had lied to him, and unless something unforeseen happened
it would be but a matter of a few minutes’ time before
the crystal was in his own hands. It was true that Joseph
might not know the exact hiding place of the crystal; what he
did know was that the men in the tower would kill his father
if he did not return at once with the prize, and he and the
mother would make a quick search of the house in order to find
it and redeem the father. It did occur to Peter that perhaps
Pan Andrew had deposited it elsewhere, but if the house did
not give up its prize, then they would return and try to torture
the information out of the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay,” he said suddenly, just as Joseph’s captor delivered
the boy into his hands, “the hourglass there on the table shows
that the sand has fallen to the second hour. It is time that
the trumpet was sounded from this place, otherwise some one
may suspect that something is wrong and come up here to see.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You, boy—you trumpet sometimes, I know. Surprises
you, does it? Peter has eyes and ears everywhere. So, before
we set out to get this precious stone, take down that
trumpet from the wall.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, leave it there a moment,
and come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led him to the bell rope outside and stood over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ring twice upon the bell, then get your trumpet and play
your Heynal from the four windows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched the boy carefully, with his knife gleaming in his
hands, as Joseph tugged twice at the cord that moved the hammer
against the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do as you always do, and play no tricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Joseph went back to the little room and took up the
trumpet he was thinking of another young trumpeter who,
standing in the old tower over this same spot, had fallen
pierced by an arrow while performing his duty. And it
seemed curious that he too was called upon to show his mettle
in much the same way. In his heart much of the first tumult
of fear had died out. There had come to him that gift of
everlasting stanchness which had been one of the most characteristic
qualities of the Polish people. It was perhaps the inspiration
which the thought of that other trumpeter had
brought, for immediately afterward and at the minute that
he had thrust the trumpet through the tower opening on the
west, his mind flew back to his conversation one day with
Elzbietka. He had spoken in jest that day about the Heynal,
but she had taken it as a childish secret—bless her!—he was
sure that she would remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This hope increased instantly. He knew that Elzbietka
was awake at the second hour; she had known that it would
be at that hour that he would take his father’s place, and if
the Heynal was played straight through and two or three
notes were added at the end where usually the music broke off
on the broken note, she would know that something was
wrong. What would she do? Her uncle, lost in his experiments,
would only laugh at her fancy, as he would call it.
Would she dare in the night to go to Jan Kanty? If she did,
it was possible that Kanty could summon the watch quickly
enough to save his father’s life, for he felt in his heart that
Peter meant to kill Pan Andrew after the crystal was found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It all depended on this. Did Peter know the story of the
Tartar invasion and the broken note at the end of the Heynal?
God must be trusted that he did not. This prayer was
on Joseph’s lips as Peter said, “Now for your music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up went the trumpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it seemed to Joseph that he had once done this very
thing before. The whole world changed beneath him. The
great stone city had become wood, and it was everywhere in
flames. Men of short stature and ugly faces were riding
about furiously on little horses. Close at hand a man had
descended from his horse and had drawn a bow from his
shoulders and an iron-tipped arrow from a quiver. The bow
bent, the arrow was notched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter nodded. The Heynal was not new to him, and he
knew that the boy was playing as usual—that is, he knew up to
a certain point. Joseph hesitated at the place where the music
ordinarily breaks off—this time he added three notes of his
own which definitely finished the Heynal. It took courage to
play those notes, for he knew not but that at any moment he
might feel the Cossack’s dagger in his throat. At length he
let the trumpet fall and looked about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood surged into his head with a rush. The Cossack
was nodding approval! He did not know, then!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the windows at south, east, and north, successively,
and played as he had already played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now hurry for your lodgings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter gripped the boy’s arm and pushed him ahead all the
way down the stairs, after giving final orders to the men
who guarded Pan Andrew. They found no one in the square
below and slunk along in the shadows toward the university
district. The Cossack was exulting again that his plans were
working, and as he went along he looked about him for a quiet
corner where he could finish Joseph with his dagger once he
had the crystal in his hands and was on the way back to the
tower. Then they would settle with the father and there
would be no one left to give information concerning them.
A company of Armenian merchants would leave the city unhindered
in the course of the following day.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ELZBIETKA MISSES THE BROKEN NOTE</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>V</span>ery</span> much earlier on this same eventful night a girlish
figure emerged from the door leading to Alchemist
Kreutz’s lodgings on the third floor of the building
where Pan Andrew lived, and stole quietly down the steps to
the second floor. Here she rapped three times. In a space
of perhaps a minute, the door was thrown back a little, and
Joseph’s mother peered cautiously out through the crack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, child,” she said heartily as she recognized Elzbietka’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brings you out so late?” she inquired a moment later
as she shot the heavy bolts back into place and secured the
door. “Has the student Tring been troubling you or your
uncle lately, or what is it? Sit there at the table where I was
just finishing my sewing for the day and tell me the whole
story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered the girl, “it is the student Tring. He and
uncle are in the loft now, and I am somewhat frightened—they
have been talking more queerly than ever all this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must stay with me here this night,” the woman said.
“It’s a shame that such a scholar as your uncle should have
anything to do with that student, Tring. I fear that young
man very much. He seems to me like one who has grown old
and then become young again. When he looks at me with
those great dark eyes it seems as if he were thinking of
terrible things——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will stay here, and gladly, mother,” she answered, for in
these months of sweet acquaintanceship the affection of the
woman and girl had become much like that which exists between
mother and daughter, “but it is not that I fear anything,
myself, from the student Tring. It is really my uncle’s conduct
these few weeks that troubles me, and more especially his conduct
since that night when the men came here to steal. He is
so changed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen,” Joseph’s mother replied. “But has he ever
been cruel to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! Never that. But he is not at all as he was when
we first came here to live. Then he was full of merriment,
ready to talk or laugh with me, eager to go somewhere or to
see something that would be of pleasure to us both. Now he
does not seem to think of me, at all. He is always like one
in a dream. Sometimes when I speak to him, he does not
seem to hear. Other times he answers my questions queerly,
saying things that I had not thought of. He is caught up in
something that I fear, and something that has little good in
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the student Tring who has done all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think that he has done much of it. They two are
together every night, and they work together in the loft above
my head. I can hear them moving about occasionally, though
sometimes a terrible silence is all that there is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child,” the woman laid her work by for the moment,
“this is always your home here. Come here when there
is anything to trouble you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The little bed is always
yours.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We, too, are greatly troubled as well, as
perhaps you know. Pan Andrew has not been the same since
that accursed night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet if one had but sense, we
have here all that should make man happy: children, love,
bread, and a house—why must men be always sighing and
striving for that which they have not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were so happy before,” continued Elzbietka. “It
seems to me that the student Tring has some charm over my
uncle which he cannot resist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven help us,” exclaimed the woman, making the sign
of the cross. “And have you any idea what is going on in
the loft above you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None.” The girl shuddered. “It is some terrible thing.
To-night both men spoke in such a peculiar way that I was
frightened when they first came together. And ever since that
they have been speaking more wildly, I think, than ever before.
My uncle keeps saying, ‘This will drive me mad,’ and
Tring says to him again, ‘There is nothing of harm in it. Try
once more.’ Then again there is silence and my uncle speaks
shortly, mad things—and I was frightened and came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just before I came downstairs Tring was speaking to my
uncle as if he were just a common servant. And my uncle instead
of being angry seemed to be trying to please the student.
At last Tring said: ‘This, now, you must do. You
must learn the secret which will change brass into gold. Once
you have gold, then you have the power to do all that man can
do. You can go about over the earth and see all that there is
to see, you can study with the most famous masters and buy all
that you please.’ He repeated over and over again the word
‘gold,’ and it seemed to me that while he was speaking my uncle
was working at something, for he never answered a word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman shook her head. “I have known of those who
sought to make gold out of baser metal. But no good ever befell
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Then thinking that she needed to draw
the girl’s thoughts away from herself and her troubles, she
said, “I am often lonely these nights when Joseph and his
father are away. Yet I often listen for the sound of the
trumpet in the church tower and I know that everything is
well with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I. Joseph begins at the second hour. We have a
secret, he and I, and I always listen for him to play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless your heart. Do you mean to say that you lie awake
until the second hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do when he is playing. For he is my best friend, and
one should be loyal unto friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell when he is playing, and when the father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could easily at first. Now it is much harder, but I think
that I could distinguish did I not know at what hours each
played. His notes are not quite so pointed as the father’s,
but they are becoming more and more like them all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation ran to other matters and it grew late.
Finally the woman made up a bed for the girl on a small couch
which Joseph and his father had built. It was close to the
outer door, and directly below the casement, over which a
piece of tapestry hung; the window was open in this fair
weather, and Elzbietka could easily hear noises from outside,
especially the sound of the church bells and the trumpet, for
the window faced in the direction of the tower. Joseph’s
mother retired to the second room, where she slept when
Joseph was at the church, and Elzbietka, without undressing,
for she feared lest the alchemist should call her suddenly,
threw herself on the couch and tried to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found sleep impossible. Visions of some terrible thing
happening to her uncle and the student kept her thoughts boiling
like water in a kettle. She kept remembering the words
that other people had said, the remarks made by other students,
the whispers up and down the lane that Pan Kreutz
was engaged in some terrible work of Black Magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a superstitious age, an age when people believed that
powers of evil could be called upon, like human beings, to perform
certain dark deeds—that souls of the dead forever
haunted certain lonely places on earth and would answer a
question if one but knew how to address them. If a black cat
crossed one’s path, then bad luck was sure to follow; if an owl
hooted at exactly midnight from the tower of some deserted
church then the witches were riding through the air on brooms
or branches; if a dog howled in the night it was a sign that
some one living near by was about to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were people who fostered such ideas for their own
benefit. They were for the most part necromancers or magicians
who took the gold of credulous ones for telling them of
their own futures or for warding off some impending evil from
them. Perhaps some few of these believed themselves honest;
the greater number were thoroughly dishonest and unscrupulous,
men who wore dark robes and practiced dark ways simply
to frighten superstitious folk into giving them money. These
magicians sold articles called “tokens” which were guaranteed
to keep away certain evils. A little ball of black stone would
prevent the possessor from being bitten by snakes. The little
yellow, glasslike substance, created when lightning struck in
sand and melted the fine particles, was greatly valued; crumbled
and taken internally it would prevent stomach trouble. Worn
about the neck in a small bag it would keep off lightning. Certain
little bones from the bodies of cats, dogs, and hares
had properties of benefit; the heart of a frog had many mystic
qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite apparent in the case of the alchemist, Kreutz,
that something was going on that was undermining his health
and perhaps his reason. Such a change as had come over him
was not at all normal in a man with such a strong body and
mind as he possessed. And as Elzbietka lay awake thinking of
one thing after another she became a prey to many strange
fears, among them this one, that Kreutz was no longer the
master of his own soul, that somehow the student Tring had
become the master of it; that Tring had discovered something
in his studies which he was working out at the expense of the
man who naturally should have been his teacher and master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trumpet had in the meanwhile sounded the first hour,
but still she was not able to sleep. Her natural thoughts of
her uncle and Tring were followed by a flood of fanciful imaginings,
and in them she saw the figures warped and distorted
out of their natural proportions; persons who are sick and persons
who carry troubles in their minds experience this frequently,
at a time when the body is tired and aching for sleep and
yet when the mind is overactive with worries. Her uncle at
one minute of normal and ordinary size seemed at intervals
to shrink or enlarge without warning; Tring was now a student
of the collegiate type, now a nightmare of a thing with
the head of a pumpkin that grew until the whole sky was filled
with the darkness of his shadow. They were engaged in
many nefarious enterprises: they were releasing great hordes
of bats from baskets, bats that they had created out of old
sandals; they were leaping into the air and catching huge birds
like eagles which they were imprisoning under the roof of the
loft; they were mixing fiery liquids that hissed and bubbled and
foamed—they were doing a thousand things at once and all
of them somehow of evil. For nearly an hour these phantoms
of half sleep danced in her brain, and then suddenly the bell on
the tower sounded twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second hour,” she exclaimed, the drowsy phantoms of
her brain taking sudden flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Heynal began. “That is Joseph,” she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was humming the tune, already following him note by
note—she reached the place where the hymn ended, and ceased
there, to wait until he began to play again from the second of
the four windows. But the next second she realized to her
vast amazement that Joseph had not stopped upon the broken
note that came at the end of the Heynal, but had added a note
or two, and brought the little hymn to an end in the way that
pieces of music usually end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elzbietka sat upright on the bed, although she was quite
certain that some trick had been played upon her by her senses.
“Perhaps I was but half awake,” she thought. “I will listen
more closely when he plays it the second time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to play from the south side. This time she did
not hum the tune over but followed each note intently. When
he had finished she realized that for the second time he had
not stopped upon the broken note but had gone ahead with
the additional notes which made the Heynal sound like a
finished piece of music and not one that was broken off.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/153.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0009' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>is</span> playing it wrongly,” she repeated to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He played next on the east side but the wind carried the
sound away this time. When he came to the last window, the
window on the north, the sound came clearly to Elzbietka’s
ears. “This time I shall know,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first she thought that he was going to stop upon the
broken note, for he hesitated there, but then he went on ahead
as if to say, “I know that I should stop here, but am not stopping,”
and added the extra notes which finished the strain, just
as the young trumpeter would probably have finished it had
he not been shot down by the Tartar bowman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elzbietka was off the bed and on her feet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He
had played it in such fashion deliberately! Joseph was far too
good a trumpeter to make the same mistake at least three
times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what—what—could it mean? That Joseph was in
some trouble? But there was the great alarm bell, which once
sounded would rouse the town in an incredibly short time. This
bell was always employed in times of fire, invasion, defense,
and such various events as riots, the visit of a foreign king,
the declaration of war——</p>

<p class='pindent'>He certainly would not trifle with such a sacred thing as the
Heynal for a mere pastime—therefore, why, why, why, did he
not ring the bell?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There could be but one answer! The girl had half realized
it with the very first false note of the first playing of the Heynal.
This was a signal to her—to her, Elzbietka Kreutz!
Joseph was in some strange, some unusual kind of distress!
He counted upon her to remember the little secret that he had
made in joking, he counted upon her to understand that he was
in trouble. Why, perhaps he was even held by force—here
her intuition actually leaped to the truth—perhaps some person
was watching him so that he could not ring the bell!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, it was for her ears that he was playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she must act—she must help Joseph—at once—<span class='it'>at
once</span>. Only, what was the wisest course? She could not
bring herself to alarm the boy’s mother—should she call her
uncle? He was still with Johann Tring in the loft—the light
was there and there had been no sound of the student descending.
Both, she knew, would laugh at her fears and send her
back to bed. Therefore she moved quietly from the couch
across the floor to the door where she threw back the bolts and
drew the door open. Stepping across the threshold she closed
the door and ascended to her own lodging where she procured
the key to the outer door, and threw a cloak about her head
and shoulders. In a very short time she was in the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At such an hour as this in the morning, it was dangerous
for an unarmed man, and even more for an unarmed woman,
to pass through the streets. Late roisterers were abroad,
gamblers, drunkards, thieves, the very filth and scum of the
city, were crouching in corners or picking the pockets of some
man who had been struck down from behind. The city watch
were preventive enough against crime if they responded in
numbers large enough to cope with thieves and murderers who
often worked in bands, but the law satisfied itself with treating
most cruelly the few prisoners that fell into its clutches, and
let the great majority of offenders go unmolested. Therefore
a man’s best friend in dark city streets, particularly at such
a late hour as this, was his good sword or cudgel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once outside the building wall Elzbietka breathed a prayer
to her patron saint, the good Elizabeth, and observing in the
bright light of the moon that the Street of the Pigeons was for
the moment empty, kept her back close to the wall and edged
her way slowly in the wall’s shadow to the cross street at the
left, through which she had planned to dart for St. Ann’s
Street, only a block distant. She was at the very corner and
had climbed out from the sheltering buttress of the wall when
there came the sound of men’s voices from the Street of the
Pigeons directly behind her. Without turning about to see
who was there she darted around the corner into the cross
street and broke into a run over its rough cobbles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one, however, had seen her. She heard a voice cry,
“Who is there?” and there was the sound of feet pursuing
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman, as I live,” she heard a pursuer say as she dashed
ahead. The moon seemed to hang over the very head of the
cross street, so that none of the buildings threw a shadow.
The pursuers had already turned the corner from the Street
of the Pigeons and came flying ahead in great leaps and
bounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought of Tartars and Peter of the Button Face, but it
was no such folk as that who followed her. This small company
of men was but a band of rags and tatters, beggars and
petty thieves and filthy cozeners, seeking only to fleece some
passer-by of a few grosz in order to get drinks or a hard corner
in which to sleep. A girl of her age was just such prey as
these wretched people sought, for they could plunder her without
fear of harm, and her clothing or perhaps some bundle
that she carried would bring a few coins for their need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! Stop! We are friends,” the first of them called
out. “We would not harm a woman in the street at such an
hour. Listen, we will go with you where you are going.” But
the tone of the voice only made Elzbietka run the harder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into St. Ann’s Street she turned at length, with the men
close behind. Her one hope now was that Jan Kanty would
answer his bell quickly, for if she did not slip inside almost immediately,
the men following would catch up to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, summons for help from Jan Kanty seldom waited
long without an answer. He had been busy all that night with
his writings, at which he worked incessantly, when he was not
aiding some world-wrecked soul—writings which were to
prove of inestimable value to the university and the whole
world of culture after his death. Therefore the ringing of
the bell took him but a few steps from his work. As he unlocked
the door and flung it open the girl darted by him and
into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I, Elzbietka Kreutz,” she said. “Good father, I
come with news that needs action, I think, and that immediately.
But first close the door, since there are some pursuing
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scholar closed the door. If he felt astonishment at the
sight of a young girl flying through the streets at such an hour,
he did not show it. He was, as a matter of fact, used to all
kinds of strange happenings. Even when the wretched beggars
raced past the door wondering what had become of their
victim, he had an impulse to go out and talk to them and
eventually share his purse with them, since he knew that it was
only poverty and starvation that drove them to such extremes.
But recognizing the girl’s distress and her immediate need for
him, he closed the door and led the way into his study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened, daughter? Has there been a robbery
again in the house or has thine uncle gotten himself into some
difficulty? Something of the sort there is, I feel and know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She recited her story as best she could, for she was short-breathed
from running and from her anxiety for Joseph. If
only he would not smile! If only he would not think that she
had been dreaming! But the venerable scholar was far from
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” he exclaimed spiritedly, almost before she
had finished her tale. “There is no time to wait. He is in
some grave danger which may the good God divert from him.
Remain here where you will be safe. I will at once send a
servant of the university to call the watch, and will go with
them myself to the tower. I fear something of evil has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later thirty men of the city watch, in heavy
armor, were marching upon the church. They found first the
church watchman securely bound in the churchyard and released
him. Then they entered the tower through the unlocked
door, and began silently and cautiously to climb the
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the band of Cossacks high up in the tower
above had begun to grow weary of this excursion. At first
the idea of an attack in mid-air, and in a church tower at that,
had piqued their curiosity and aroused their thirst for adventure,
since such an attack had heretofore been entirely outside
their experience. And when earlier in the evening Peter had
called for the ten volunteers he needed, not one man among
them could be induced to remain behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the affair had proved to be of a simplicity that had no
appeal for men so bloodthirsty. In truth, so well had Peter’s
plans been laid, and so secure from intrusion did they feel in
this lofty stronghold, and so irksome was the waiting for their
leader, that they had succumbed one by one to the drowsiness
of the early morning hour and with the exception of the one
man who stood guard over the trumpeter, they were sprawled
out idly, or were dozing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore men of the city watch, when they had crept noiselessly
to the top, surprised them completely. In truth they
were captives before they were quite on their guard or realized
what was happening. Pan Andrew’s guard himself did not
have time to carry out the leader’s command—he was in fact
made prisoner, as he was upon the point of delivering a deathblow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they were binding the last prisoner’s arms, Joseph
came running and leaping up the steps and threw himself into
his father’s embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, father,” he shouted excitedly, “it was Elzbietka
who did this.” His eyes were shining as he thought about it.
“Elzbietka—Elzbietka,” he kept repeating. “She heard me
sound the trumpet in a different fashion from the way I usually
sound it, for to-night I did not stop the Heynal upon the
broken note, but played several notes more. She ran through
the night alone to Jan Kanty’s and he aroused the city watch.
I just met him at the foot of the stairs and he told me the
whole story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless the girl,” said the father, tears rising to his eyes.
“And you, my son, how did you get free? I feared——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who was dragging me toward our home heard
the watch marching through the street, and when he realized
that they were going toward the church he took himself off
like lightning into the darkness without another thought for
me. But Elzbietka is at the scholar’s dwelling in the university
building, waiting. I must go to her quickly and tell her
all, and thank her that we are alive this night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew was busy with his own thoughts when the watch
finally marched away with their prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Great Tarnov Crystal! The Great Tarnov Crystal!
That was what the Tartar said he had come for. Was it
possible that the man had been telling the truth? For what
other reason could he have surprised him thus in the tower?
For what other reason the hurried expedition into the town
with the boy, Joseph, and the instructions he had left with his
men? If it had been revenge alone that the man was seeking,
then he and Joseph would never have remained alive until
now. But if the man had not obtained the crystal on the night
of his attack upon his lodgings, then what in the name of
heaven and earth had happened to it on that night, and
where was the crystal now?</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GREAT TARNOV CRYSTAL</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was late one evening in April, a few weeks after the unsuccessful
attack of Peter upon the tower, that the alchemist,
Kreutz, and the student, Johann Tring, were sitting
upon rude stools in the loft above the alchemist’s lodging,
arguing with much heat some question that had arisen between
them. The day had been sultry for early spring and the sun
was setting red over the distant hills, flooding with its crimson
the high mound called the Krakus Mound over beyond the
river on the road to Wieliczka and the salt mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring sat where he could see the sunshine through the little
window, but the alchemist sat within the gathering darkness
of the room. Above their heads on the slanting walls vials
and glass tubes of the alchemist’s craft gleamed like precious
stones, and every now and then some substance lying upon the
hot coals of the braziers would hiss up into a little flame and
smoke, for all the world like a serpent suddenly raising its
slender head and coils above a quiet patch of grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you that I have had enough,” the alchemist replied to
some remark of the student’s. “I am ready to forswear this
scientific experiment into which we have so boldly launched
and go back to my old studies which are much better suited to
a God-fearing man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring laughed, low but maliciously. “So that is where your
courage lies,” he answered. “That is the crown of valor that
you boast in exploring the wonders of the unknown world.
Come,” he added after a minute, as if changing his tactics in
dealing with this man who was now thoroughly in his power,
or so he thought, “come and put a better complexion upon
things; we are already past the hardest stretch of the road—if
there is to be found the solution to that problem upon which
we both have spent so much time, it will be found so much
the more readily now because of the sacrifices that we have
already made for it. Are the trances tiring you beyond endurance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist let his head sink into his hands. “I am tired—I
am tired,” was all that he could say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring regarded him with disgust, but held back the angry
words which sprang to his lips and expressed himself more
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if there is a fault it must lie with you, Pan Kreutz,”
he said. “It is beyond my understanding that such a man as
you should find exhaustion in these simple experiments that I
have performed. Many another person I have put into
trances similar to yours, and for longer periods of time, too,
and there has been no harm, nay, nor physical exhaustion from
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas,” the alchemist moaned as if making a confession, “I
have been in trances other than those of your making, and almost
continually, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” Tring leaped to his feet in astonishment. “What
do you say? You have been in trances induced by others?
Other men share our secrets, then? Who may it be that is
also a master of this rare craft? I had thought that no others,
save I, in this town were able to bring about such trances.” He
glared at Kreutz with open hatred and let his fingers stray
as well to the handle of a short knife that he carried in his
belt, for although he was but a young man, he took his occult
powers very seriously. There was as well an element of fear
in his emotions, since the civil authorities of that day dealt
usually in short and severe fashion with persons brought before
magistrates on the charge of indulging in dark or occult
practices. Death even was prescribed as punishment for
some, although disfiguring, whipping, stocks, and banishment
were the most common penalties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring’s powers, though mysterious in those days, could be
easily explained in ours. The so-called trances into which certain
persons have the power to send others we call in these
times merely hypnotic sleep. Hypnotism in the days when all
men and women were to an extent superstitious was looked
upon as one of the very worst works of a malignant devil upon
earth. Tring possessed to some extent the ability to summon
hypnotic sleep to a willing patient, and the alchemist had become
a too willing patient in his endeavor to discover the secret
that Tring had made appear so desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as is the case with most practitioners of hypnotism
and their subjects, the hypnotist had gained, little by little,
more and more power over his co-worker, until in a few
months the alchemist had become merely a tool in the hands of
Tring, who, knowing his ability and scholarly accomplishments,
did not hesitate to use them for his own ends. He did this,
however, with great caution, and enjoined ever upon the alchemist
the need for the utmost secrecy, for if it had become
known that such tricks were being practiced, the law would
make short shrift of both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man,” answered the wretched alchemist, “no <span class='it'>man</span>, but
perhaps—devils!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devils?” Tring stood motionless, thunderstruck. Was
the alchemist losing his mind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, devils. I can stand it no longer.” The alchemist
rose from his stool and turned upon Tring. “You who have
powers greater than man, know most of what is passing in my
soul. The secrets of my craft, the sciences of actions and reactions—all
these you know. But I hold from <span class='it'>you</span> one secret,
one great secret which has bowed my shoulders with care and
blackened my heart with crime. Come, watch, I will show
you something that has powers beyond those of which you
dream. See .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” His accents became wilder and his voice
trembled. He shuffled about the attic as if making preparations
for some experiment. He set up a tripod in the very
middle of the room and linked the top with chains as if he were
to set a bowl upon it; he unlocked a great chest that stood in
one corner under the eaves and took from it some object
wrapped in black cloths, and this object he placed upon the tripod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let us have a light,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook some powder into a brazier full of coals which
suddenly leaped into flame. As the whole room burst into
existence with the illumination there appeared most prominently
in it the tripod which bore the covered mystery. The alchemist
whipped the cloth covering away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if he had uncovered a diamond of the finest water!
Upon the brass top of the tripod gleamed in that instant a very
miracle of color and light; the object itself was about the size
of a man’s head. Upon this exquisite thing no artificial effort
of man had been expended; it was as nature had fashioned it in
the depths of some subterranean grotto where drops of water
falling in steady succession for thousands and thousands of
years had slowly created it. The outer layers were clear like
the water of a mountain spring; as the eye fell farther and
farther within the surface a bluish tint was perceptible and at
the very center there was a coloring of rose. Such was its absolute
beauty that whoever looked into its depths seemed to be
gazing into a sea without limit.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/165.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0010' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of Heaven,” shrieked Tring, “what is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist spoke in a low voice as one might speak in a
church: “The Great Tarnov Crystal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Great Tarnov Crystal!” repeated Tring. “The
Great Tarnov Crystal! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, that is the stone for
which alchemists and workers of magic have been searching
these hundreds of years. The Great Tarnov Crystal!” He
shouted it almost in high excitement. “Why, man, we have
here the greatest scientific treasure of all ages.” He began to
skip about in transports as the possibilities of the treasure’s
possession leaped into his mind. “And now I understand,” he
continued. “Indeed you have been under the hand of a devil if
you have been gazing into that thing. Why, do you know that
this stone can send a man into a trance in which all manner of
truths will be divulged? Do you know that we can learn now
for a certainty the very secret that we have been seeking?”
And going close to the stone, he gazed into its depths as a
thirsty man might gaze into a well of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was this curious property of the Great Tarnov Crystal,
and perhaps of all great crystals in the world’s history,
that it never presented the same vista twice to the man who
looked within its depths. Now this may have been due to
many things, to the fact that the lights surrounding it were
never twice the same, and also perhaps to this, that the crystal
had the strange property of reflecting back to the observer
the very thoughts that were tucked away deeply in his head.
What drew men to the Tarnov Crystal in the beginning was,
of course, its beauty, its color, its light, its constantly changing
vistas, and besides these, there was that indefinable fascination
that all such stones have. Diamonds, as well, possess this
fascinating power to a high degree though the diamond is, of
course, a small stone, and not large enough to hold the concentrated
focus of two eyes for a very long time; the crystal
by reason of its size possesses this quality according to its
fineness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tarnov Crystal was the finest crystal known to the
magicians of the Middle Ages. And although magic was
frowned upon by scholars and men of science such as astronomers
and alchemists, still there was no distinct line between
science and magic, with the result that many of these men
found themselves practicing magic when they had intended
only to make scientific investigations. It was even so with
Pan Kreutz, who ordinarily had but little use for magic or the
Black Arts in any form—until now he had come entirely under
the domination of the student Tring whose enthusiasm had
carried him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you that I have had enough,” the alchemist repeated
now. “I have perjured my soul to obtain this stone and I am
ready to return it to its rightful owners. This stone is a thing
of wickedness and blood and it has a woeful history, as old
perhaps as the world itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Return it!” shouted Tring. “Return it! Why, Pan
Kreutz, listen to my reasoning. I know not how you have
come by this thing—I do not ask at present—but you would be
scarce the man I took you for did you not use it for the purpose
that we need it. After that we may return it—if indeed
it has been stolen—or if it sticks within your conscience to retain
it now, then perhaps I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, Johann Tring,” exclaimed the alchemist emphatically,
“to its rightful owners it shall go. Here I have
kept the secret to myself knowing that the knowledge would
tempt you—and indeed you would not have known now unless
the secret had burned so heavily in my brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will,” said Tring, humoring the alchemist with his
concession, though the purpose in his eyes was of different intent,
“but first let us learn from it at once how to transmute
baser metals into gold; this I am sure we shall do, then we
can be independent of these smirking dogs who rule the universities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let our experiments be brief,” said the alchemist. “I
have looked too long upon this glittering thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have told me before.” Tring again adopted
the attitude of a kindly adviser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, in truth,” went on the alchemist, “I doubt if we can
wring that secret from the crystal. I have now an opinion,
though perhaps a wrong one, that the crystal only gives us
back our own thoughts. We may not call upon it as upon
some friendly spirit to tell us what we do not know—we may
not wish and have our wishes fulfilled. I begin to doubt it
all.” Here he rose to his feet and began to stride about the
floor. “It is already having a bad influence upon me. I cannot
see straightly in the world of men as once I did. When I
have looked into it for minutes and minutes my thoughts come
back to me crookedly, and while I have taken much interest in
such contemplation, I find that there is too deadly a fascination
in gazing into those crystal depths. I have, as I said, found
much of interest, and were I alone in the world, I might even
pursue these studies to the very limits of human thought, but
I sometimes feel as if my very soul were getting caught in the
rays of that bright thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might I ask,” inquired Tring, unable to restrain his curiosity
longer, “how the crystal came into your possession?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was like this”—the alchemist willingly relieved his mind
of the secret that he had been bearing alone. “That night
when the thieves came here some time ago I entertained them
for a bit with some Greek fire and niter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems that the crystal was at that time in the possession
of the family in the rooms below ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! The trumpeter and the boy who bear the name
Kovalski?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, though that is not their name. They are Charnetskis
and lived formerly in the Ukraine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see—and the thieves? Tartars and Cossacks who followed
them perhaps from the Dnieper country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the crystal was actually in the hands of the leader
when I surprised him with an explosive powder. In the surprise
and pain occasioned by my attack he dropped the crystal—the
powder blazed about his face and burned his hair—the
crystal rolled upon the floor and I pounced upon it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how had it come into the possession of the Charnetski
family?” asked Tring eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in this fashion. When the Tartars devastated the
Polish country in the thirteenth century the village that stood
where now is Tarnov was inhabited by the Charnetskis, among
others, of course. It was Andrew Charnetski of that day
who performed heroic feats in the defense of the city against
the Tartars, and to him was presented for safe-keeping the
great crystal which has come to be known as the Great Tarnov
Crystal. It was the chief ornament of the old town, and even
kings had come there to see it. For besides its qualities as a
thing of rare value and beauty, it had those reputed properties
you have mentioned: that a man who looked into it might
there read the secrets of the past and the future; that he
might find out the intimate thoughts of other men and women;
that he might learn to overcome the elements, to fly through
the air like a bird, to walk invisibly, to transmute base metals
into gold. In those times no man was allowed to look more
than three minutes upon it, for even in three minutes a man
might find his head swimming and curious thoughts coming
into his brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did the Charnetskis save it from the Tartars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They fled with it to the Carpathian Mountains and remained
there until Batu the Tartar was forced to return to the
land of the Golden Horde. Then as it passed from eldest
son to eldest son, it went to an ancestor of this Andrew Charnetski
who settled in the Ukraine after the country had been
put under Polish dominion in the days of Vladislas Jagiello.
Of course the name Andrew Charnetski is by no means an uncommon
one throughout Poland, so little did I think when this
man came into the humble lodgings below that he belonged to
the Charnetski family which had possession of the Tarnov
Crystal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he tell you his story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. On the day after the crystal disappeared, he made
a confidant of me as one already acquainted with his name and
a part of his history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you had heard of the crystal before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What alchemist has not?” he answered. “I knew that it
was brought in early days to Egypt from somewhere in the
East, and there it stood in a temple for many centuries. When
the Romans conquered Egypt, the crystal was taken to
Rome. During the years when the Romans were colonizing
the lands around the Black Sea a certain Roman officer fell in
love with a woman of Transylvania, and being sent there with
a legion, stole for her this crystal from a temple in Rome.
When his crime was discovered the Emperor sent a detachment
of soldiers to bring him back, but he fled to the district
which is now Halicz, but which went then under the Roman
name Galicia. There he lived with his wife under an assumed
name, in a remote village later known as Tarnov, and there
the crystal remained up to the time that it passed into the
hands of the Charnetskis. Around it grew up a sect of sorcerers,
magicians, practicers of the Black Art, astrologers, and
alchemists—some sincere, others mere charlatans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely there have been many attempts to steal the crystal
from the Charnetskis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one. It seems that men, even alchemists and
astrologers, lost for a time the thread of its history, and it
was only when a runaway servant of Andrew Charnetski
spread the news in the East that it was in his possession that
an attempt was made to find it. That attempt, as you know,
cost Pan Andrew his house and property in the Ukraine. Who
it is that is inciting these robbers I know not, but I have no
doubt that the leader of the band was in the pay of some person
in high authority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would the robbers taken prisoners say nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they did not know all, I believe. And like most Tartars
they would rather die than betray a secret. Torture could
not wring it out of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Pan Andrew suspect that you have the crystal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pan Andrew considers me his friend. And at heart I am
ashamed and sick that I have not restored it before now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think. If it had not been for you, the Cossack would
have escaped with the crystal and it would have been lost forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it. Yet that is no justification for me. I stole it
if a thief ever stole anything. When I first saw it that night
on the floor of Pan Andrew’s lodging I would have exchanged
my chance of heaven for its possession. When I had obtained
it, and the attention of the crowd in the court below was
turned to the robbers and to the man escaping over the roofs,
I brought it here to the loft, under my coat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did well,” said Tring, the wildest impulses of excitement
leaping within him. “Look—look at the crystal. It
glows and dances and quivers like a thing alive, ready to tell
its secrets. Quick, draw your chair near to it as you used to
draw your chair to me when I was the master of your trances.
Gaze deeply into it”—he fixed the hesitating alchemist with
his eyes as a serpent might fix a helpless bird—“and now let
us try the greatest experiment of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist pulled his chair close to the crystal as he was
bid, and fixed his eyes upon it. Tring watched him closely
from a distance. One minute—two minutes—three—the alchemist
still looked at the crystal and Tring regarded him as a
cat might regard a mouse that it was playing with. Four
minutes—five. The alchemist still sat motionless, but his posture
in the chair was changing slightly. His arms and neck
seemed to be stiffening, his face was taking on the look of an
entirely different person; his breath came regularly but in
longer and deeper draughts than was his wont. His eyes became
wide open and staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” Tring’s tone was sharp, commanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am listening,” the reply came instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring trembled with excitement. Not only had the alchemist
gone into this trance more quickly than he, Tring, had
ever been able to send him, but he was still responsive to the
student who had feared lest the agency of the crystal might
render Kreutz unresponsive to him. But Tring had sent him
into trances so many times that now his mind seemed to answer
the student’s bidding automatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see a huge hall like an alchemist’s room, filled with
braziers and glass instruments. In these instruments fluids of
fire are rushing to and fro and near them are great copper
kettles out of which are coming puffs of steam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the devil’s workshop that you are in,” said Tring
sharply. “Do you see any men at work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence a moment as the alchemist’s consciousness
went roaming through the vast room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no one here,” he said at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there any manuscripts there?” demanded Tring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence again. Then—“Yes, on the wall hangs a parchment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It burns my hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pay no heed to that. Your reward will be greater than
your pains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in my hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tring glanced involuntarily at the hands of the man in the
trance. Curiously enough they seemed to be turning red as if
exposed to a great heat. “Now read what the parchment says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist replied slowly as if reading, and he spoke in
the Latin tongue, “<span class='sc'>Here May One Find Things Which Be
Neither Good Nor Evil But Which Are Sought of All
Men</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Now unroll the parchment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another silence. At length the alchemist said, “I
have found somewhat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, I may not. It is in symbols.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then write.” Tring deftly slipped a piece of board across
his knees and put into his fingers a kind of pen made of wood
and a feather; this he had dipped into a pot of ink as thick as
paint, and he guided it in the alchemist’s hand until it rested
upon a piece of fresh white parchment that he laid upon the
board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist wrote as follows:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/175.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0011' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist wrote:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Quod primum incredibile, non continuo falsum est; crebro
siquidem faciem mendacii veritas retinet.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. That’s nothing. Do you find other formulæ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist looked closely and recited as if reading:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus saith Olimpiodorus of Thebes, Osthanes the Egyptian,
Psellos of Byzantium, and Giabr of Arabia: heat the
fires upon thy brazier and place thereon a vessel full of yellow
sulphur; this thou shalt melt until it gives forth a spirit; when
the spirit is departed pour slowly upon the sulphur that quicksilver
which has its birth in the planet Mercury. In but the
twinkling of an eye this will be reduced from its natural state
unto a state that is of the earth, black, without life, dead.
Then take this lifeless substance and put it in a closed vessel;
heat it and it will suddenly take on life again and become a
brilliant red.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Write it, write it,” exclaimed Tring. The alchemist
wrote. “And is there more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much. It saith here that this is the secret of the Seven
Golden Chapters, of the Emerald Table, and the Pimander.
<span class='it'>Natura naturam superat; deinde vero natura naturae congaudet;
tandem natura naturam continet.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more of that. That is vile philosophy,” shouted
Tring. “Find and write the completion of the Philosopher’s
Stone, by which we may convert brass into gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zosimus the Theban directs that this is the true method of
turning brass into gold: To the above heated solution of sulphur
and mercury add that pure niter which men find in the
heart of India. Into this cast brass and it will in a moment
change to gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, to work. Light the braziers and bring out sulphur,
quicksilver, and brass,” commanded Tring. “Have you any
of this Indian niter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have—a small packet on the third shelf of the closet,”
answered the alchemist. Tring rushed to get it and set all the
materials ready for the experiment. Truly and sincerely did
he believe that the alchemist had hit upon the solution of the
much desired process of changing base metals into gold, and
his own lack of knowledge in the realm of the science of alchemy
was responsible for the ignorance with which he ordered
the alchemist to compound one of the most dangerous chemicals
known to man. The alchemist, on his part, was but acting
under the hypnotic suggestion of Tring, and had no opportunity
to interpose his normal-self sense between the student’s
intention and its execution. Indeed the information
he had during the trance came from his own fund of learning,
although the suggestion of adding niter to the heated compound
was but a fancy of a mind grown either tired or weak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the student hurried about arranging materials for the
experiment Kreutz sang a Latin hymn which extols the practice
of alchemy and the alchemist:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Inexhaustium fert thesaurum</span></p>

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Gemmas de lapidibus.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Compound the Philosopher’s Stone,” commanded Tring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist, still in the trance, arose, and leaned over the
brazier. Something flaky and white and inflammable was
tucked close to the bottom to act as kindling, and a coal
brought from a farther brazier and laid upon this. It turned
all black for a minute, then sizzled into an intense heat and ignited
the brazier’s contents. The flame was at first yellow
and creeping, then it changed to blue and leaping. Kreutz put
a vessel filled with sulphur into the flames, and sure enough in
a moment the spirit of the sulphur arose in fumes that filled
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both leaned over the brazier eagerly as the alchemist shook
mercury over the melted sulphur. As the parchment had decreed,
so the reaction followed; in a short time the glittering
mercury had mingled with the melted sulphur and became an
ugly black substance. Tring handed to Kreutz another vessel
which was closed at the top. Kreutz shook the hot material
from the first vessel into the second and put the latter back on
the brazier. In all his motions he acted mechanically as if he
were but working out the will of another. He opened this
second vessel after a few seconds and, sure enough, the black
substance was becoming a lively red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The niter; the niter,” exclaimed Tring eagerly at his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alchemist took the package from his hands and tossed
it into the substance now seething with heat. As he did so,
as if obeying some unconscious instinct of self-preservation, he
leaped back into the middle of the room and drew Tring with
him. The exclamation of anger on Tring’s lips was cut in
half, for at that instant the loft of the house rocked in a terrific
explosion!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, seize the crystal and descend!” screamed Tring,
who was already speeding through the doorway, frantically
wiping sparks of fire from his clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exploding substances had sent their flames into the dry
roof and walls of the house, and fire was leaping through them
merrily. Everything in the room was beginning to blaze, and
in two minutes more it would have been impossible to leave.
The alchemist, still in a daze, took the crystal as he had been
commanded, and made for the stairway. The stone gleamed
in his hands like a million diamonds, rubies, and emeralds
where the flames fell upon it, and he clutched it with all the
strength of his right hand as he clung to the stair rail with his
left, now swaying out over the court like a drunken man, now
regaining his hold and descending another stair. But the student
had been more nimble, and by the time that the alchemist
had descended to the third floor of the house, Johann was
down the stairs and through the gate, calling with all his
might for the watch to notify the water master that the house
above him was in flames. No watch was in sight and so he
sought one at full speed, and while he was searching, Pan
Kreutz had reached the open door and disappeared in the
night, the Great Tarnov Crystal hidden under the folds of his
black gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But behind him the flames had eaten through the roof of his
house and had leaped to the adjoining house. In a few
minutes they had bounded clear across an open court near by,
and had laid hold of one of the pensions of the university.
The wind then veering swept the flames in a seething mass in
the direction of the great Rynek, and in less than fifteen
minutes after the flight of the two men from the loft of the
building, the university section of Krakow was in the grip of
a terrible conflagration that threatened to devour the whole
city.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A GREAT FIRE RAGES</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>ince</span> earliest times Krakow was divided into four sections—the
Castle Quarter, the Potters’ Quarter, the
Butchers’ Quarter, and the Slavkov. At the head of
each of these districts was a quartermaster who was responsible
for everything that went on in his district, the fighting of
fires being one of his chief concerns. Therefore the watchman
from one of the streets that lay in the districts threatened
by the fire went pounding at the gate of the quartermaster’s
house, shouting “Fire” at the top of his lungs in order to send
the servants flying to the master. In a short time the quartermaster
was up and dressed, and had sent summons to the water
master who had charge of the town reservoir and aqueducts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell meanwhile began to sound clamorously from the
tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary, for the watchman
there had caught sight of the flames. Cries of “fire” were
now being echoed from all sections of the city, and in the red
glare which was beginning to illumine all the grim Gothic
buildings and churches, a very tumult of confusion was arising.
The water master had already set his machinery in motion and
drummers were pounding away at their drums in all the city
streets in order to awaken the merchants and their apprentices
upon whom fell the burden of fighting the flames. All the
town guilds were assembling, companies of servants from the
palaces were filling buckets of water and taking positions on
the roofs of their own houses, and all citizens were busily getting
down from the wall, hooks and axes and pails such as the
law required them to keep for such emergencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fire of any size in Krakow was a serious thing in those
days, for there were hundreds upon hundreds of wooden and
part-wooden houses clustered together in the thickly populated
streets. In the section about the old university the majority
of dwellings were very ancient, dry, and cobwebbed everywhere,
and a single spark upon their roofs was enough to turn
them in exceedingly rapid fashion into belching furnaces of
flame and smoke. As the fire raced through these streets, the
inhabitants poured out in panic-stricken confusion; each building
was literally teeming with life, and the whole scene, viewed
from above, would have resembled a huge ant hill suddenly
destroyed or burned out by a careful gardener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women and children came out rushing and shrieking. Black-robed
students dashed through the streets with manuscripts
and parchments in their hands; others came carrying glass
tubes or astrolabes or metal dividers; frantic domestics ran
here and there with no definite refuge in view save only to
escape the heat and terror of the ever-spreading flames. The
streets were rapidly filling with furniture, clothing, beds, and
personal possessions of every variety, hurled out of casements
by desperate owners—and some of this material in the streets
had already caught fire from the sparks which were descending
like rain in a spring thunderstorm, making the lot of the fugitives
even more unendurable. Inside some of the courts those
who had preserved presence of mind were combating the fire
with much vigor; tubs of water and pails were being pressed
into action, and burning walls were already being hauled
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water master had marshaled a line of water carts which
extended from the burning buildings to the aqueduct; these
water carts were usually drawn by horses, and some of them
were on this night, but there had been difficulty in getting
enough horses quickly, and men and boys were harnessed into
the shafts. At the aqueduct men were busy filling the carts
with water; as each cart was filled it moved on some little distance
to the fire, and there being emptied, swung about into
another street and returned to the aqueduct for another filling.
The nearest section of the aqueduct was about an eighth
of a mile from the point where the fire started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forces of men armed with hooks and axes were sent out by
the water master to surround the district where the flames
were reaching, for the rapid spread of the fire had made it apparent
at an early stage that very little could be saved in the
university area. These men were under orders to demolish
any building that seemed to offer a chance for a further spread
of the blaze, whether the fire had already reached it or not.
One detachment formed a line in front of the Church of the
Franciscans, another on St. Ann’s Street, and another on
Bracka. All these detachments were forced to retreat, however,
as the fire ate its way out of the district where it had
started. The Rynek was the scene of a turbulent mob which
had struggled from the burning section in the Street of the
Pigeons, and every open space was quickly filled with rescued
goods. Two families had even taken possession of the platform
where the town pillory stood and children were being put
to sleep there by mothers thankful to find a place of rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amid all this uproar, an elderly woman, a boy, a girl, and
a dog were fighting their way through the Street of the Pigeons
amidst the débris of furniture and personal belongings that
had been thrown from windows. They had all been sleeping
when the fire broke out, and not having been roused until the
flames were all about them, had been able to rescue nothing but
themselves and the clothes which they wore. The boy was
Joseph, the girl, Elzbietka, and the woman the wife of Pan
Andrew. Wolf, cut loose by Joseph, was the most terror-stricken
of the group, but he followed after them, submissive
and obedient, not knowing exactly what he was expected to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each of them was busy with separate thoughts as they fought
their way through the disorder. Joseph was ever figuring the
quickest route out of the burning district, and this was no easy
task, since the fire was playing so many tricks. It was not
marching ahead in a straight wall of flame but was whirling
about, leaping here and there, skipping this house and fastening
upon that, advancing, retreating, spreading to the flanks,
all with terrific speed and unexpected vivacity. Sometimes the
two roofs just above the heads of the fugitives would shoot up
in flames—passing these with great peril, they would find that
the fire was now behind them and rejoice at the breath of air
that fell upon them; then suddenly without warning the roof
of a building just ahead would belch forth smoke and flame
as if the fire demon were working invisibly, and this new peril
must be passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length they reached the place where the Street of the
Pigeons is cut by a cross lane, known to-day as Wislna Street,
but this lane was already full of smoking beams and fallen timbers;
escape that way was impossible. There was nothing to
do but to push on through the Street of the Pigeons where it
curves to meet Bracka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elzbietka was wondering most of all about her uncle; there
had been no answer to their hurried calls when they left the
doomed house, and, besides, the loft was glowing in red and
purple flames of such intensity that no person alive could have
been there at that time. Joseph’s mother was thinking of the
father, wondering if he had left his post at the church to come
to his family’s aid, and wondering, too, if they could reach
him at the tower before he began to suffer too much from anxiety
concerning them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The houses were a little higher in this portion of the street
and there was therefore more cool air, in the lower reaches.
The fire was still whirling along here but was not taking hold
quite so fast as it had done down below, and consequently the
fugitives made better progress. The only difficulty was the
ever-increasing crowd that now swept in from three directions,
making it hard for the three to keep together. Finally they
locked arms and literally fought their way through the crowd.
All about them the scenes were heart-rending, men and women
fleeing with but few possessions from the only homes they
had ever known, children lost in the mad scramble who set up
shrill cries and tried to keep their feet as the crowd pushed
ahead. Sick persons were brought into that raging torrent
of humanity, carried on the shoulders of their relatives or perhaps
stretched upon cots. Here was one old man who sat
astride a young fellow’s neck like Anchises on the back of
Æneas fleeing from the burning city of Ilium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length they stood where the fire had not reached, much
more fortunate in that than many other people that night.
Joseph waited only until they caught their breath, though he,
too, felt like throwing himself down upon the ground and resting,
and then started forward again through Bracka in the direction
of the Rynek. In his heart he hoped that when he had
settled Elzbietka and his mother in the tower where his father
was on duty, he might come back with the apprentices and help
fight the fire, for there is that in a youth which draws him
into such fighting. As they went along Bracka he heard the
sound of horses’ hoofs from the direction of the Wawel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” he said, drawing the women back on a footpath,
“here come soldiers from the castle to preserve order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke truly, for the next moment a great troop of cavalry
wearing mail armor and carrying spears rode into Bracka
Street from below and began to deploy in lines that marked
the district immediately threatened by fire. A few minutes
later foot soldiers and artisans began to appear and, joining
with the watch, pulled down buildings at the edge of the fire.
Siege machinery was also drawn up into Bracka and the buildings
just outside the reach of the fire began to crumble under
its pounding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will prevent the spread of the flames,” thought
Joseph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went ahead again toward the church, but while they
were still in the Rynek they saw a company of soldiers dragging
forward a prisoner whom they had taken in the burning
district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thief,” said the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless us,” exclaimed the mother. “It is not possible that
men could be so cruel as to steal from poor folk driven mad
with terror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the company came near and the torches fell upon the
face of the prisoner, Joseph let out a cry of amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, mother, that is Peter of the Button Face, the leader
of the men that attacked our house. That is the man who
met us on the first day we were in Krakow. He it was who
tried to make us prisoners in the church tower.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See
how he struggles—but they are holding him tight for all that.
And mother, it is not the city watch that has taken him. It
is the King’s own guard. Do you not see the royal crown on
their helmets, do you not notice the richness of their clothing?
I wonder what it can be about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph spoke truly. Peter had at last fallen into the hands
of guardians of the law, and this time it was the King’s own
men that held him. It was evident, too, from the way they
held him that they thought they had a prize. They did not
stop at the Town House where offenders against municipal
law were kept but marched straight along Castle Street in the
direction of the royal castle on Wawel Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the church they found Pan Andrew in a very sweat of
anxiety and fear lest something of harm had befallen them.
He caressed them all one after another and then said to
Joseph earnestly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to remain here and sound the Heynals for the
rest of the night. There is much work to be done in the quarter
where the fire is, and every man’s hand is needed to stay
the flames.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I see that Pan Kreutz is not with you.
He stayed, too, I presume, to work with the rest of the men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, father, I know not. We called many times, but
his loft was a mass of flames like to a roaring furnace, when
we were driven down the stairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must see, then, if I can find aught of him. He has been
on a previous occasion our very great benefactor and it would
but suit us ill not to seek at least his body in the ruins. Should
he not have perished, as I pray God he has not, then we can
offer him shelter here until such time as he can find a roof
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Joseph told him of the capture of Peter he looked
very serious and said that if such people were in the city then
he had better not leave his wife and the young people. On
second thought, however, it seemed right for him to go, for
the city was now lighted by flames and it would be easy to summon
aid if they were attacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he, with thousands of other valiant men, fought the
fire in Krakow that night. They formed in a ring about the
conflagration and tore down all the buildings across which
it might run. The Collegium Minus was the last building to
catch on the side toward the city wall, and then the fighters
tore down the houses near the old Jew Gate and stopped the
fire there. The flames swept around the other buildings of
the university, destroyed one or two, though not all, and were
finally halted on the second street above St. Ann’s. Sweeping
in the other direction, the fire had early in its progress destroyed
the monastery and adjoining houses of the Church
of the Franciscans, and had crossed over to Castle Street where
it burned flat a whole line of buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On these and the other edges of the district a wide belt of
destruction was created by the fighters. This belt, the tradesmen,
running to and fro with water wagons filled constantly at
the aqueduct, wet down and soaked until it was almost a water
wall. So furiously had they worked that the main progress of
the fire was checked in seven or eight hours, and although certain
buildings and ruins smoked and even blazed for several
days afterward, yet the great danger passed when this well-soaked
belt of destruction was completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Pan Andrew returned to the tower in the full blaze
of the morning sun, nearly one third of the city of Krakow lay
in ruins. Fortunately it was not the better portion of the city,
and many of the old wooden-built hovels had been there since
before the days of Kazimir the Great; that monarch had successfully
converted about one half the city of Krakow from
wood to stone more than one hundred years before; had he
not done so it is probable that the fire of 1462 might have
utterly consumed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elzbietka and Joseph’s mother were asleep on the trumpeter’s
bed clasped in each other’s arms. Joseph sat outside the
compartment with the hourglass before him on a beam, gazing
out over the smoking ruins of the university quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the city saved?” was the first question he asked his
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not now in danger,” answered Pan Andrew. “But
there are many homeless souls in the city this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see the alchemist?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not. He has disappeared as if he had flown away
on the clouds of smoke that covered the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Elzbietka,” exclaimed Joseph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl inside the compartment moaned slightly as her
name was spoken, although she was deep in a heavy slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if he was caught in the loft?” mused Pan Andrew.
“It was in the very center of the burned district.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer to his question came with sudden unexpectedness.
There was a sound of footsteps on the stairs and Jan
Kanty’s head appeared from below. The scholar was leading
another man by the arm, a man who had been in the fire—his
charred clothes and blackened face showed it; around his
shoulders and falling to his waist was all that remained of
what had once been a black robe. He kept his hands beneath
this robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pan Andrew,” whispered Jan Kanty softly, “I have found
in the street—Pan Kreutz.” And, checking the other’s startled
exclamation, he explained, “He is not in his right senses.
Something has affected his brain. But he has here something
of interest to us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew turned toward Kreutz—he never would have
recognized him had not Jan Kanty identified him; Joseph felt
his eyes glued with strange eagerness upon the eerie, blackened
figure and the mysterious folded hands beneath the robe; it
had been a scholar’s robe once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed the alchemist suddenly, “up to
heaven goes everything in fire and yet no gold is found anywhere.
Johann Tring!” he looked about anxiously. “Where
is Johann Tring? He answers me not. He is lost in the
flames, the flames that came so red and purple when niter mixed
with charcoal. Oho, Johann Tring! Come, Johann Tring,
and see what I have carried this whole long night for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing back the black robe, he held up the object that he
had been concealing there, and at the same moment the sun,
streaming in through the little window on the east side, fell full
upon that object; fell upon it and made it sparkle like the
myriad of dew diamonds shining upon a morning lawn new-mowed;
sparkled like the thousand chandeliers in the King’s
great hall in the palace on the Wawel Hill; sparkled like the
rubies and emeralds that gleam in the Queen’s crown; sparkled
like the wondrous thing that it was, all touched by the red
rays of the morning sun—the Great Tarnov Crystal!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now whence has that come?” shouted Pan Andrew so loudly
that the sleepers in the next room awoke. “Where by all
that is good and holy in the world have you found the gem
which has been in my family for years and years, which all
my ancestors and I have sworn to guard forever and to surrender
to no person except to the King of Poland? How has
it come into your hands after it was stolen from me, and my
heart was nearly broken? Did you get it perhaps from that
ruffian who has been captured by the King’s guards? Did you
find it perhaps in the ruins of the town? Did you perchance——”
The truth suddenly flashed upon him and he was
speechless.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/189.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0012' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“It is an accursed thing,” cried out the alchemist suddenly,
reeling in Jan Kanty’s arms as if he were gone faint. “There
is blood upon it, and fire! It has lured princes and kings to
their destruction! It has made men’s brains mad with lust
for want of it! It has caused good men to steal, and evil men
to kill. I will have none of it. I will have none of it, I say.”
He was growing almost boisterous, yet there was something in
this attack of madness that had much of reason and determination
in it. “I will have no more of it,” he repeated, “and no
more of Johann Tring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that he fell fainting to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Kanty raised him, and Elzbietka who had run out from
the trumpeter’s room rushed to him and kissed and fondled
his blackened hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew picked up the Great Tarnov Crystal and held
it at arm’s length with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now may peace come upon us all,” he said, “for I may fulfill
the oath that my family has taken and deliver this to the
King. While the secret of its hiding place remained with me
I might keep the crystal as long as I chose, but now that the
secret is out, there is but one place where it may be guarded
safely and that is in the palace of the King. Pan Kreutz is
right. This jewel has already done too much harm in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you may rid yourself of it at once,” broke in Jan
Kanty. “The King returned to Krakow two days ago, and
we may find him at the castle this very morning.”</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KING KAZIMIR JAGIELLO</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>f</span> all the wonders that the capital city of Poland
possessed Joseph knew of none that stirred his imagination
more than did this royal castle of the kings
upon the Wawel. Impregnable through many sieges, its great
rock base had stood, brick and stone heaped high above it in
a great mass of towers, turrets, and walls. At its very heart,
high above the winding Vistula and the town, stood a strangely
built round tower enclosed and protected by the palace
wings, where men in prehistoric times worshiped the old
nature gods of the Slavs; a place of rest and seclusion where
on rare occasions, when townsfolk might visit the castle,
Joseph had stood thinking of things that had been in the old
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew well the legend of Krakus, the hero of the dark
ages, who slew a dragon that had once made this hill his habitation.
There was a cave, so Joseph heard, that ran from
the fortress underground beneath the river, a secret exit in
time of siege; here had been the dragon’s lair, until the hero
overcame him, and from that day men made the Wawel a
home, from which might be seen climbing into the air, spires
and belfries. All this Joseph had seen; he had fed his fancies
upon every object that graced the bleak, majestic rock, and
yet there remained one glory that had never yet met his eyes.
That glory was Poland’s King.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/192.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0013' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>But this morning after the fire, when the little company set
out from the Church of Our Lady Mary toward the Wawel
Hill, Joseph felt his heart leaping strangely in his breast at the
thought of the adventure that was to be theirs. To see the
King, to have audience before him—it made the blood sing in
his ears and tingle in his finger tips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took the alchemist with them, on Jan Kanty’s advice,
although he still seemed like a man in a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found him wandering through the fire-swept streets early
this morning,” said the scholar. “He had been running hither
and thither all night long in the most dangerous parts of the
city, and how he has escaped death from falling timbers and
burning coals is more than I know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The man has something
on his mind, something that troubles him hugely, and
with it all he seems to be acting like one in a spell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it well to bring him with us?” asked Pan
Andrew, who had doubted from the beginning that there would
be any benefit from the man’s presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I have a curious notion,” answered the scholar, “that
he may be able to help us. We have much to explain to the
King, and the man’s presence will make our story more credible.
And who knows, perhaps the alchemist himself may get help—he
needs some light thrown into that brain of his, and since he
is harmless, it will do no damage to take him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Kreutz’s hands and face had been washed and dried,
and most of the fire grime had left him; the scholar’s robe was
useless, however, and Pan Andrew hung a <span class='it'>kontusz</span> or long coat
about his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph was there with the three men; Wolf had been left
behind sleeping upon the floor of the high tower room.
Joseph’s mother and Elzbietka were under the protection of
the day watchman who relieved Pan Andrew at dawn. It was
necessary for Pan Andrew and Jan Kanty to assist the alchemist
in walking at times when his feet would shuffle curiously
like those of a man walking in his sleep, but he plodded
along bravely, not yet realizing quite clearly what was happening
about him yet confident that the two men near him were
his friends and were leading him to some good place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Castle Street they turned at length up the long slope
leading to the castle on the Wawel. Behind them lay street
after street of desolation, of smoking ruins, of masses of wood
still flaming; amidst these ruins men were still working valorously
tearing down charred beams and hurling in tons and
tons of water from the water wagons, which were now all
drawn by horses. One side of Castle Street had suffered badly,
the houses on the Street of the Pigeons were entirely destroyed,
St. Ann’s Street had but few buildings left, while much
devastation had been done along the Street of the Bakers, the
Street of the Goldsmiths, and the Street of the Jews and Broad
Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jan Kanty’s company was challenged twice by guards on the
way to the palace, but when the soldiers recognized the good
father, they were at once passed along without question. It
was another proof to Joseph of the esteem in which the man
was held; in himself, however, there was not the least indication
of pride and ostentation, he was as simple as a child in
most matters affecting worldly things, and yet his name was as
magic even in the court of the King. At length they all stood
in the little passageway on the Wawel through which one
passes to the palace, and here the guard, with spear raised in
salute to the scholar, bade the company wait until he went to
see if an audience might be had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldier came back quickly. “The King,” he said gravely,
“will grant any request that may be made by Father Jan
Kanty; he only begs that the company wait a few minutes until
a present audience is finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited perhaps fifteen minutes until an important-looking
functionary in a blue robe came to announce that King
Kazimir Jagiello would receive Jan Kanty and his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out into a wide court they went, following the courtier in
blue, up a marble staircase to the left and along a balcony.
Then suddenly a door was flung back and they were in the
presence of the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Joseph, remembering it afterward, it all seemed like a
dream, it was all so quiet and without ceremony. King Kazimir
had chosen to receive them in a small antechamber in
which he often met certain persons who were to be received
without the usual ceremony of presentation, and Jan Kanty
was one of the privileged ones that he met in such fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph and his father dropped upon one knee in front of the
King. He was sitting in a high-backed chair without a canopy,
which bore at its highest peak a royal crown; this crown was
just above the monarch’s head so that at first it seemed as if
it were actually upon his head and he were crowned. He wore
a huge purple robe which fell clear to the tops of his soft
leather sandals; it had a great collar embroidered with silks
of many colors and in many patterns; a heavy gold chain held
the folds of the collar together, and beneath the collar folds
could be seen a rich vest embroidered with gold. The sleeves
of the robe were immense and hung down far below his knees
as he sat there; the robe itself was fringed with heavy fur.
His head covering was a simple cap of the same color as the
robe, flat, soft, and turned up a trifle at each side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King himself seemed the picture of comfort and informality;
not so his guards. On each side of him stood a
guard in plate armor, with stiff metal pieces over the arms,
stomach, thighs, and legs. At the waist they wore short,
straight swords ready for action at a second’s notice. These
two men were as motionless as statues. About the room stood
knights in different kinds of armor, some in light chain
with long skirtlike coats, some in mail jackets that resembled
checkerboards in pattern and extended only from shoulder to
thigh, some in heavy armor and metal shoes armed with spurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the King were two pages carrying scepters.
They, too, stood motionless as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this?” he asked, as Jan Kanty came forward to
kiss his hand, which ceremony the King did not allow. “Have
we here some poor city dwellers driven forth by last night’s
fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea,” answered Jan Kanty, “that is true, though we come
not on business of that sort. We are here upon some matter
that may be of deeper interest than one would suppose. These
are Pan Andrew and his son Joseph, by family name Charnetski,
dwellers of the Ukraine driven forth by violence and come
here to have audience with your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” said the King with quick interest. “Stand, if you
please, and tell me the circumstances of your trouble for it
greatly interests me at this present time. I have much news
from the Ukraine, and not so pleasant, either. How came you
by your misfortunes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your Majesty please,” began Pan Andrew, rising and
taking out the crystal from beneath his coat, “I wish to deliver
to your Highness the Great Tarnov Crystal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunlight touched it as he held it up, and the room
and its splendid company were suddenly agleam with wavy
flecks of light, red and orange and blue and yellow; there was
a dazzling brilliance to it that struck each eye with almost
the force of lightning. The King literally sprang forward
to take the wondrous thing from Pan Andrew’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a marvel! What a thing of beauty!” he exclaimed,
while a very murmur of astonishment ran through the circle of
his attendants. “Where in the world is to be found any
jewel one-half so miraculous as this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not,” answered Pan Andrew, “but it has been in
the keeping of my family for many years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you deliver it up to me?” demanded the
King. “It is worth a quarter at least of all the treasures in
this palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will explain. My family has held it in trust these
two hundred years and more, and we have sworn to guard it
until the secret of its hiding place became known, and then,
since there would be great danger following such a discovery,
to deliver it into the hands of the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then its hiding place has been discovered? But tell me
first the reason for concealing such a wondrous stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, your Majesty, is a long story, which if your Majesty
so desires I will deliver shortly in writing, but I may say
briefly that when Tarnov fell before the Tartars these many
years ago the citizens entrusted this crystal to a member of
my family. He took oath to guard it zealously, with his life
if need be, lest it fall into the hands of people who might abuse
its powers, for its beauty hides strange properties which are
allied to magic and sorcery and the Black Arts, and it has
been at times a curse, a thing of mystery and a source of evil.
When Tarnov was rebuilt new dwellers came there and the
crystal remained in our family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did the secret become known?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a servant, a Tartar. He was with me for many
years. It was my custom to conceal the crystal in the rind of
a pumpkin, and many a time this man must have seen me scraping
out the inside of a pumpkin and rubbing the shell with oils
and gum in order to preserve it. Because he was a simple fellow,
I took no pains at any time to conceal my task. But
though lacking in wit, it seems that the man was not lacking
in curiosity. And his curiosity, I now believe, led him to spy
upon me, and eventually he discovered the use to which I put
the preserved pumpkin rind. He left me about a year ago,
and it was only a few months later that my house was attacked.
I am sure that he sold his information to some Tartar chieftain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could he suspect the value of the crystal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I do not know. I do know, however, that legends
concerning this crystal are everywhere to be found among the
Tartars and Cossacks. When they are children they are told
tales of it, and all of them grow up in the hope that some day
they may find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou thing of beauty,” said the King, gazing at the crystal,
“could thou but speak and tell all that men have done to
possess thee. Thou cruel, marvelous thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew fell upon his knees before the King. “Take
this crystal and guard it, your Majesty,” he exclaimed with
great feeling, the tears already streaming down his face. “It
has already done enough harm in the world. In my own
family it has been nothing but a burden, a source of endless
anxiety and suffering. My father’s fathers, years and years
ago, even dug a passageway in the earth, through which one
might escape with it secretly in case of an attack, and so cleverly
was this passage concealed that for years no one but the
master of the family has known of its existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of the beauty of this jewel I hate it from the very
bottom of my heart and I hope that I may never look upon it
again. For every ray of light that it reflects, thousands of men
have fought and died for its possession, for every color that
lurks within its depths miseries and sufferings have swept over
whole nations. I have guarded it faithfully but no more shall
I guard it. I am fulfilled of my oath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King looked into the crystal fixedly, and then suddenly
shuddered as if he saw something fearful there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be before many years an old man,” went on Pan
Andrew, in a pleading tone. “My home in the Ukraine exists
no more. My house is burnt, my fields are laid waste, and
all because I had this jewel in my possession and men envied
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then went on to tell the story of the escape from the
Ukraine, the pursuit, the attempted robbery of his house, the
attack on the tower, and the persistency and repeated appearances
of Peter of the Button Face whom he had heard of in
the Ukraine as Bogdan the Terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” he said, “who it might be that sent this
man to dog my steps, but my son Joseph has told me that your
guards have taken this same Peter a prisoner in the streets,
and that he is a captive of your men. Let me confront him
here and perhaps I may learn who it was that drove me from
the Ukraine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was speaking the King gradually took his thoughts
from off the crystal, and when he mentioned the name Peter,
the King grew restless with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the man,” he exclaimed, “and he shall be brought
here. My spies in the Ukraine reported recently that a great
treachery was afoot and that this man Peter or Bogdan was
in Poland for the purpose of consummating it. His description
was given to my guards and a reward was offered. Last
night he was seen in the district where the fire was raging
and my guards brought him in. I shall have him here
directly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two spearmen brought him in; as he walked, the chains
which hung from his arms and legs clanked on the floor. He
did not deign at first to glance at Pan Andrew or any of his
party, but simply looked at the King and folded his arms defiantly
and with spirit. Whereat the two guards forced him
to his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His air of indifference disappeared, however, when his eyes
fell upon the Tarnov Crystal which the King had set down upon
the floor before him. He glanced left and right and
favored the trumpeter and the alchemist with a look of bitter
hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are accused of treason against the Commonwealth of
Poland,” said the King immediately. “Have you any plea
to make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who accuses me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The governors of the Ukraine,” answered the King. “And
moreover you are charged with other crimes, among them
that of persecuting this citizen here before me—you have destroyed
his home and fields, and attacked him while he was on
duty in the church tower. The penalty for any one of these
is death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter did not lose his self-assurance for a moment. He
realized more quickly than another might that his plea of innocence
would soon be broken down. He fell back then
quickly upon another means of obtaining his end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would buy my freedom,” he asserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you that is worth while to me?” asked the
King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much. You are threatened in the Ukraine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King thought for some minutes. It rather irked him
to give this man his life since he had already done such damage,
but on the other hand he might be able to obtain some
really valuable information. The whole Ukraine was in some
kind of uproar, and even his most trusted spies had not been
able to get to the bottom of it. The usual method of obtaining
information from prisoners in those days was torture, and
in the field of battle it was employed widely, but often in cases
of such desperate men as Peter torture led them to confess
wildly but seldom with truth. The Cossack was ordinarily a
man of his word, and Peter had enough Cossack blood in him
to make him pass for a Cossack in the Ukraine and in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It pleases me to be merciful to-day,” replied the King.
“There has been too much suffering at my very gates to make
me wish for more. Your death would in no way pay for your
crimes, and it is possible that your information might be of service
to the commonwealth. I could wrest this information
from you by torture, but I prefer an easier way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now,
mark,” he cautioned the Cossack, “I know certain facts concerning
what you have to tell, I have information from my
own men in the Ukraine, and if you utter so much as one word
of a falsehood to me, I will have you taken out and
hanged by the neck from the tower gate. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” answered Peter, turning just a trifle pale
at the threat. He was a bold man, he was a desperate man—otherwise
he would not have ventured back into Krakow
after having been defeated there twice—and he had no fear of
death in any form, so long as he was free and able to fight.
But now his knees smote together at the thought of hanging
and he resolved that he would keep close to the truth. After
all, the whole affair was finished for him. The crystal was in
the hands of the King and he was not likely to part with it
easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing,” he said in a low tone, “one thing, your Majesty,
I beg, and that is that you will let none talk of what I say.
For if it were known that I had spoken the truth, my life
would not be worth—that,” he snapped his fingers. “I have
your promise, your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then hear what I have to say. I am Bogdan, known in
the Ukraine as the Terrible. Two years ago in March I was
summoned to Moscow by one in authority who said that a
powerful lord had something to say to me. Now having an
open mind always for new activities, I went, although our people
have but little love for Muscovites. And there I was
taken to one Ivan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King interrupted. “You mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean Ivan himself, chief power among the Muscovites,
son of that blind one. He has the ambition to unite all lands
thereabouts under himself—as Emperor, men say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King bit his lips and his eyes flashed. “This they have
told me,” he exclaimed in an angry voice. “I only wanted the
confirmation of it that you have given me. Ivan—Ivan—that
one who makes friendly proffers to one’s face and strikes
in treachery when the back is turned.” He strode up and
down the room for a moment and then turned to the captive
again. His tone was as calm as it had been in the beginning.
“Proceed,” he ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this he has partially succeeded, but his ambitions run
higher, and he dreams of establishing his power over the people
outside the borders, the Ruthenians and Lithuanians.
Knowing them to be willingly under Polish domain, however,
even the city of Kiev which fell beneath Tartar rule, he wishes
instead to strike a blow at the Poles in the Ukraine. Some one
advised that he loose the Tartars against the Poles, and an
ambassador was even sent to find out what would induce the
Khan to send his warriors to fight the Poles. The answer that
he made was a curious one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that was——” asked the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was his answer. He would lead his Tartars against
the Poles in the Ukraine on one condition, and that was
that Ivan should deliver into his hands the Great Tarnov
Crystal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the whole company started, chief among them Pan
Andrew, for none of them had suspected that such great importance
was even now attached to the stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did he know of the crystal?” asked the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one in the east knows of the Great Tarnov Crystal,”
answered Bogdan. “Every worker of magic, every astrologer,
every chief, every prince, is desirous of possessing
this treasure. For it is said that in addition to being a jewel
of great value it has this quality also, that one may look into
it and there read of the future—one may also find there secrets
of great worth, one may see the faces of men long since in
their graves. There are many legends and stories of it, too,
and since the days when it disappeared from Tarnov, when
the Tartars conquered Western lands, there has been search
after search to find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King thought for a few seconds. “Then the Khan of
the Tartars knew that he was asking Ivan for an impossibility
when he demanded the crystal? Does that mean that he
meant to refuse to go against the Poles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please—your Majesty—it was no such thing,” Bogdan
stated emphatically. “A short time ago a servant who had
left the services of this man here,” he pointed to Pan Andrew,
“went to the land of the Tartars and there spread the report
about, that the crystal was to be had for the taking, that it was
hidden in a country house in the Ukraine. You may be sure
that this reached the ears of the Khan, whose passion for curious
jewels is almost a madness, and when I, going from Ivan
to Tartary, learned this, then Ivan promised the Khan that
he would get him the crystal if it could be gotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were the go-between?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bogdan bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Ivan sent you to get it from Pan Andrew?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bogdan bowed, though not quite so low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fire leaped into the King’s eyes. “Dog that you are,” he
said. “Less than beast in all things that Christians believe;
for this you must destroy a man’s house and ruin his fields,
yes, and threaten his life, too, if it would serve your purpose.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God knows, my kingly duties lie heavily upon me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
All that I seek in this, my commonwealth, is peace, peace with
my neighbors and happiness for my people. And yet Poland is
ever insulted to the point where nothing but war is possible. It
is not enough that enemies on the north and west threaten,
there must be plots against our happiness on the south and east.
Oh, Poland, Poland, when will the day come that thy sons and
daughters may enjoy the tranquillity that God has designed for
all people? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As to you,” he turned again to Bogdan,
“what further have you to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that I have failed,” answered Bogdan miserably.
“And only that I know that I shall go free, for there was
never yet Jagiello who did not keep his word. Though had it
not been for this creature here”—he pointed to the alchemist,
who from the rear of the room had been watching the scene
through half-shut eyes—“I should have had the crystal long
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/205.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0014' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The King did not reply. “Take him away,” he said to a
guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A captain in armor came forward. “Deliver this Bogdan
at sunrise to the guards of the Florian Gate. Tell them to see
that he has safe-conduct through to the border, but that his
chains are not to be struck off until he reaches the frontier.
After that let happen what will, but if he so much as sets foot
again upon Polish soil he shall be hanged to the nearest
tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had departed, he said to Pan Andrew:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this my right and duty of kingship in the Commonwealth
of Poland I commend you most heartily as a man who has
been of great service to his country. It is a most extraordinary
and gracious thing that a family such as yours should be
so faithful to its word through so many years and be willing
to suffer so much for an oath once given. Therefore to you
go my whole thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the gold chain from his throat. It was a thing
of wondrous beauty, of heavy solid links cut out of the purest
metal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wear this,” he said placing it with his own hands over Pan
Andrew’s shoulders. “This chain shall ever be to you the
token of your faithfulness. I shall see to it that the state
makes return to you for the property which you have lost, for
in so losing it you have conferred a favor upon us all. Had
the crystal been taken by these thieves and delivered to the
Khan of the Tartars it is probably true that by now the
Ukraine had begun to be overrun by Tartars and the armies of
Ivan. In due time I shall see to it that a more formal and
proper reward is given you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Jan Kanty made a sign that the interview was finished
and the whole company fell upon their knees before the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, too, stooped, but only to pick up the crystal which had
lain upon the floor before him during the entire interview. It
seemed to Joseph, glancing up at that moment, that the instant
the King’s eyes were fixed upon the stone he became suddenly
oblivious to everything else that was before him, and stood as
one in a dream or trance gazing into the depths of the fearsomely
beautiful thing.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LAST OF THE GREAT TARNOV CRYSTAL</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>J</span>oseph</span> and his father were still kneeling when there came
unexpectedly a certain happening that changed the whole
complexion of the day. It came from the alchemist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been listening attentively through all the talk, he
had followed back and forth the give-and-take of conversation,
the balancing of argument, the gestures, the decisions, even
though his eyes had seemed but half open. Just at this final
moment he sprang up from his place behind the others like a
dog leaping for a bone, and snatched the Tarnov Crystal out
of the hands of the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gripping it, he rushed like one gone wholly mad straight
for the door, brushing aside a guard who fell back in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop him,” cried Jan Kanty, “he will do something desperate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They might better have tried to stop the wind. He was
through the door and out on the balcony and down the steps
to the court below, where the guards, though astonished, had
yet no pretext for seizing him since he was an honored guest,
one of the party of Jan Kanty. Through the little entrance
to the court he went at top speed, just as the King, the scepter
bearers, and the guards, followed by Pan Andrew and Joseph,
with Jan Kanty behind, raced along the balcony and shouted to
the guards below. These at once set out in pursuit, shouting
in turn to guards at the farther gates. But the alchemist was
traveling like a hurricane, and passing the men at arms at the
very entrance to the castle, he was off down the slope to the
meadows below where he swung to the left and bore toward
the spot where the Vistula curves about the base of the Wawel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew and Joseph continued in pursuit with the
guards, but the King with Jan Kanty, seeing the alchemist’s direction,
hurried to the extreme end of the fortifications where
one looks down directly to the river. At the very water’s edge
the alchemist turned and beckoned to his pursuers to stop,
threatening by his motions to throw himself into the current
which at that time of the year was swollen and swift. They
paused, helpless, waiting until he chose to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” he cried, gazing first at the pursuing party that
stood not far distant from him on the shore, and then directly
upward where Jan Kanty and the King were leaning over the
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious figure he presented as he stood there for a moment
in silence, his garments sadly disordered, his hair twitched
hither and thither by the wind, his features working from
emotion—the globe of amazing beauty in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!” His voice now rose shrill and screaming. “It
was I that stole the crystal from Pan Andrew. The first sight
of it drove honesty from my head as it has driven honesty
from the heads of many who have seen it. I saw there all
that magicians and astrologers of all ages have devoutly
wished for. I saw there the means of working out a great
name for myself, of becoming famous, of becoming envied
over all the world. I was tempted and I fell, but I shall see
to it that no more trouble comes from this accursed stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, overcome by the effort of so much speaking,
but in a second a flood of wild laughter burst from him.
“There was the student Tring,” he shouted, “yes, Tring—who
used to be my student. Because I looked so much into the
crystal my mind grew weak and he knew and I knew. It was
he who said that if we but possessed the secret of turning brass
into gold then we should have power without stint, and it was
he who first directed me to read in the glass what formula I
might find therein for such magic. What did I find there? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Only the reflections of my own crazed brain. And at last between
us we have done nothing but cause want and misery and
suffering all over Krakow. It is because of our madness that
half the city is now but a heap of ashes, that men and women
and children are homeless and in poverty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these words his voice shrank to a wail, and he stood, a
pitiful figure, his shoulders drooping, and his face turned toward
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cease, man! We are thy friends,” shouted the scholar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay. Such as I have no friends. But”—his shoulders
suddenly straightened—“with such jewels as this that cause
strife between man and man, and war between nation and nation—here—now—I
make an end!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then raising himself to such a height that for a moment
he appeared to be a giant, he swung about and hurled the crystal
into the air with all his force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun struck it there as it seemed for a moment to hang
between earth and sky like a glittering bubble or a shining
planet. Then it fell, fell, fell—until it dropped with a splash
into the black, hurried waters of the Vistula River, so that the
circles for a moment beat back the waves of the rushing torrent—then
all was as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep silence fell upon the onlookers. There was in the
man’s act something solemn, something unearthly, something
supernatural—his emotion was so great and the crystal had
been such a beauteous thing; and when Jan Kanty said, “Let
us pray,” the whole company fell upon their knees. When he
had finished a simple prayer they went forward and took up
the alchemist where he had fallen, for he had dropped down as
if he had been suddenly overcome by a sickness. They carried
him back to the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary where
his niece and Pan Andrew’s wife watched over him.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the King called the scholar into conference, and
after much parley, and much weighing of pros and cons, it was
decided that no attempt should be made to rescue the crystal
from the bed of the river. There had been in its history too
much of suffering and misfortune to make it a thing at all desirable
to possess, in spite of the purity of its beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And should its hiding place become known—should a
foreign power again seek to obtain it, what chance had such
a power with the King’s army and the fortified city of the
Wawel forever ready in its defense? Surely never had
treasure a safer resting place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so to this day it has never been disturbed, though in
later centuries many men have sought for it, and it rests somewhere
in the Vistula River near the Wawel, where the alchemist,
Kreutz, threw it in the year 1462.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pan Andrew received from the state enough recompense to
rebuild his house in the Ukraine and he repaired there that
same year, taking with him Elzbietka and the alchemist who
was broken in health for a long time as the result of his experiences.
When he came to his senses a few days after he
had thrown the crystal into the river, he had returned to his
right mind fully though he had no remembrance of the dark
scenes in which he had played a part. The student Tring must
have left for his home in Germany directly after the fire, for
he was never seen again in Krakow. In later years he gained
some fame in his own native village by the practice of magic,
in which it was said that he often called upon the devil himself
for assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph continued his studies in the university until he
reached his twenty-second year, and then he returned to the
Ukraine to manage his father’s estates. He was shortly afterward
married to Elzbietka, the friend of his boyhood days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And now since we have come to the happy end of all
things in this tale, may we close with the thought that every
Pole carries in his mind—with the words that are foremost in
the Polish National Hymn:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>May God Save Poland</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>EPILOGUE<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BROKEN NOTE</span></h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> is the year 1926. The Vistula River now no longer
turns at the Wawel Hill and plunges straight through the
Krakow plain dividing the city of Kazimierz from the city
of Krakow, but instead swings far to the left and surrounds
the whole plain, now the new city. The castles and towers
and cathedral of the Wawel still rise proudly on the hill as in
former days; St. Andrew’s which has defied fire, siege, and war
for eight centuries raises its head—two towers—above
Grodzka Street; the old Cloth Hall, beautified during the
Renaissance, still stands in the middle of the central Rynek.
And although the glory of former days is departed from the
city and the kings no longer sit in the castle on the hill, there
has come with the years the growth of a new glory, the glory
of culture as seen in the university of fourteenth century origin,
in the schools of fine arts and music and handicraft and trade.
From all Poland come students to study and to live in this
venerable city, which is Gothic in every corner and every gable
save where here and there a bit of Romanesque wall or arch
has survived the Tartar, or the Cossack, or the Swede.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the chief glory of the city is the Church of Our Lady
Mary. It no longer stands apart, a monument visible from
afar as of old—other palaces and buildings have shut it in, and
one sees its towers only, until one is close upon it. Then the
sudden magnificence leaps upon the visitor. A splendid silence
lurking in its high roof descends suddenly like the thousands
of pigeons that thunder down for particles of bread. Beneath
one’s feet is the old city cemetery; there on the walls
are the tablets and shrines; there at the south doorway are the
iron collars that once clasped the throats of petty criminals as
they stood supplicating the prayers and pennies of the faithful.
Inside, the church is a veritable miracle of beauty. Above its
exquisite wood carvings and choir rises a vaulted roof of sky
blue, studded with stars. Images of stone look down from
breaks in the Gothic fluting—tablets, banners, altars, shrines
all strike alike upon the sight in amazing beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But listen: is the organ playing? Whence come those notes
that float down from above like God’s own music from heaven?
They come from the towers, for the hour is striking on the
bell, and a trumpeter is playing at one of the open tower windows.
And that tune? It is the Heynal, the same tune
played by a young man so many centuries ago when the Tartars
burned the city—and listen, the trumpeter breaks off his
song in the middle of a note.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Four times he sounds the
Heynal, once at each of the four windows, west, south, east,
north. And many a man or woman or child on hearing that
song thinks of the days when the young life was given to
country and God and duty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Poland has been through
many fires since that time—she has had centuries of war, a century
of extinction. But in all that time the Heynal has sounded
with each passing hour and men have sworn each year to
keep the custom unto the very end of time. Hark, it is sounding
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May it bring in an epoch of peace to all men!</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to the following
persons for their services in aiding his research: Professor Roman
Dyboski of the English Department of the University of Krakow;
Director Frederic Papee of the university library, and his assistants,
Dr. Sophia Ameisen and Dr. Wojciech Gelecki; Director Adam Chmiel
of the Old Archives Building; Miss Helene d’Abancour de Franqueville
of the library of the Krakow Academy; Miss Helena Walkowicz,
a student in the university, and Madame Sophia Smoluchowska of
Krakow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Aqua Phosphorata mentioned on page 108 was a luminous liquid
compounded by the alchemist. Phosphorus as we know it to-day was
first made by Brandt in 1699. In 1602, however, Scipio Begatello exploited
the qualities of the famous Bologna Stone and its luminous
qualities, discovered by Vincenzo Cascariolo about 1595, and there are
other suggestions that similar substances were used by earlier alchemists
and magicians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the illustrations Miss Pruszynska has followed faithfully fifteenth
and sixteenth century models. Two old volumes, the <span class='it'>Codex of Baltazar
Behem</span> in the University Library, and the <span class='it'>Pontifical Ciolka</span> in the
Czartoryski Museum, Krakow, have furnished the models for the dress,
architecture, customs, and colors. For greater detail in dress, the book
of the celebrated Polish artist, Matejko, <span class='it'>Costumes in Poland of Other
Days</span>, was the authority. The decorations of the illustrations are in the
style of the Wit Stwosz altarpieces of the Church of Our Lady Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Iuramenta or Book of Oaths in the Old Archives of the City of
Krakow may be found the modified oath of the Krakow trumpeters as
it existed in the year 1671. It had been enlarged and translated from
Latin into Polish. In 1740 the Book of Oaths was rebound in the form
in which it now exists. Appended is a translation of the oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear to Almighty God that I will be obedient to their honors
the gentlemen of the Krakovian council, and faithful to the whole city
in the service which I render with the trumpet, also that I will be diligent
scrupulously in keeping watch, to the extent of my duties, to wit:
the sounding of the alarm of fire whenever and wherever it appears, in
the city, or behind the city, likewise to sound upon the trumpet the
hours of the night and day (appointed), and without the permission of
his honor the Burgomaster I will sound the trumpet at no man’s request.
I will be clean in all things and watch the fires in the tower.
And all this observe which belongs to my duties, so help me God.”</p>
